Commands
""""""""

add
===

add the specified files on the next commit::

   hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the
repository.

The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To
undo an add before that, see :hg:`forget`.

If no names are given, add all files to the repository.

.. container:: verbose

   An example showing how new (unknown) files are added
   automatically by :hg:`add`::

     $ ls
     foo.c
     $ hg status
     ? foo.c
     $ hg add
     adding foo.c
     $ hg status
     A foo.c

Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

Options:

-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories
-n, --dry-run               do not perform actions, just print output

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

addremove
=========

add all new files, delete all missing files::

   hg addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Add all new files and remove all missing files from the
repository.

New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in
``.hgignore``. As with add, these changes take effect at the next
commit.

Use the -s/--similarity option to detect renamed files. This
option takes a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must
be identical) as its parameter. With a parameter greater than 0,
this compares every removed file with every added file and records
those similar enough as renames. Detecting renamed files this way
can be expensive. After using this option, :hg:`status -C` can be
used to check which files were identified as moved or renamed. If
not specified, -s/--similarity defaults to 100 and only renames of
identical files are detected.

Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

Options:

-s, --similarity <SIMILARITY>  guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)
-S, --subrepos                 recurse into subrepositories
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>     include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>     exclude names matching the given patterns
-n, --dry-run                  do not perform actions, just print output

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

annotate
========

show changeset information by line for each file::

   hg annotate [-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l] FILE...

List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for
each line

This command is useful for discovering when a change was made and
by whom.

Without the -a/--text option, annotate will avoid processing files
it detects as binary. With -a, annotate will annotate the file
anyway, although the results will probably be neither useful
nor desirable.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV>             annotate the specified revision
--follow                    follow copies/renames and list the filename (DEPRECATED)
--no-follow                 don't follow copies and renames
-a, --text                  treat all files as text
-u, --user                  list the author (long with -v)
-f, --file                  list the filename
-d, --date                  list the date (short with -q)
-n, --number                list the revision number (default)
-c, --changeset             list the changeset
-l, --line-number           show line number at the first appearance
-w, --ignore-all-space      ignore white space when comparing lines
-b, --ignore-space-change   ignore changes in the amount of white space
-B, --ignore-blank-lines    ignore changes whose lines are all blank
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>   display with template (EXPERIMENTAL)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

    aliases: blame

archive
=======

create an unversioned archive of a repository revision::

   hg archive [OPTION]... DEST

By default, the revision used is the parent of the working
directory; use -r/--rev to specify a different revision.

The archive type is automatically detected based on file
extension (or override using -t/--type).

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - create a zip file containing the 1.0 release::

      hg archive -r 1.0 project-1.0.zip

  - create a tarball excluding .hg files::

      hg archive project.tar.gz -X ".hg*"

Valid types are:

:``files``: a directory full of files (default)
:``tar``:   tar archive, uncompressed
:``tbz2``:  tar archive, compressed using bzip2
:``tgz``:   tar archive, compressed using gzip
:``uzip``:  zip archive, uncompressed
:``zip``:   zip archive, compressed using deflate

The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given
using a format string; see :hg:`help export` for details.

Each member added to an archive file has a directory prefix
prepended. Use -p/--prefix to specify a format string for the
prefix. The default is the basename of the archive, with suffixes
removed.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

--no-decode                 do not pass files through decoders
-p, --prefix <PREFIX>       directory prefix for files in archive
-r, --rev <REV>             revision to distribute
-t, --type <TYPE>           type of distribution to create
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

backout
=======

reverse effect of earlier changeset::

   hg backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV

Prepare a new changeset with the effect of REV undone in the
current working directory.

If REV is the parent of the working directory, then this new changeset
is committed automatically. Otherwise, hg needs to merge the
changes and the merged result is left uncommitted.

.. note::

  backout cannot be used to fix either an unwanted or
  incorrect merge.

.. container:: verbose

  By default, the pending changeset will have one parent,
  maintaining a linear history. With --merge, the pending
  changeset will instead have two parents: the old parent of the
  working directory and a new child of REV that simply undoes REV.

  Before version 1.7, the behavior without --merge was equivalent
  to specifying --merge followed by :hg:`update --clean .` to
  cancel the merge and leave the child of REV as a head to be
  merged separately.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

See :hg:`help revert` for a way to restore files to the state
of another revision.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to backout or there are unresolved
files.

Options:

--merge                     merge with old dirstate parent after backout
--commit                    commit if no conflicts were encountered
--parent <REV>              parent to choose when backing out merge (DEPRECATED)
-r, --rev <REV>             revision to backout
-e, --edit                  invoke editor on commit messages
-t, --tool <VALUE>          specify merge tool
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message <TEXT>        use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>        read commit message from file
-d, --date <DATE>           record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>           record the specified user as committer

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

bisect
======

subdivision search of changesets::

   hg bisect [-gbsr] [-U] [-c CMD] [REV]

This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To
use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as
bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem
as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision
for testing (unless the -U/--noupdate option is specified). Once
you have performed tests, mark the working directory as good or
bad, and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset
or announce that it has found the bad revision.

As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
revision as good or bad without checking it out first.

If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection.
The environment variable HG_NODE will contain the ID of the
changeset being tested. The exit status of the command will be
used to mark revisions as good or bad: status 0 means good, 125
means to skip the revision, 127 (command not found) will abort the
bisection, and any other non-zero exit status means the revision
is bad.

.. container:: verbose

  Some examples:

  - start a bisection with known bad revision 34, and good revision 12::

      hg bisect --bad 34
      hg bisect --good 12

  - advance the current bisection by marking current revision as good or
    bad::

      hg bisect --good
      hg bisect --bad

  - mark the current revision, or a known revision, to be skipped (e.g. if
    that revision is not usable because of another issue)::

      hg bisect --skip
      hg bisect --skip 23

  - skip all revisions that do not touch directories ``foo`` or ``bar``::

      hg bisect --skip "!( file('path:foo') & file('path:bar') )"

  - forget the current bisection::

      hg bisect --reset

  - use 'make && make tests' to automatically find the first broken
    revision::

      hg bisect --reset
      hg bisect --bad 34
      hg bisect --good 12
      hg bisect --command "make && make tests"

  - see all changesets whose states are already known in the current
    bisection::

      hg log -r "bisect(pruned)"

  - see the changeset currently being bisected (especially useful
    if running with -U/--noupdate)::

      hg log -r "bisect(current)"

  - see all changesets that took part in the current bisection::

      hg log -r "bisect(range)"

  - you can even get a nice graph::

      hg log --graph -r "bisect(range)"

  See :hg:`help revsets` for more about the `bisect()` keyword.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-r, --reset          reset bisect state
-g, --good           mark changeset good
-b, --bad            mark changeset bad
-s, --skip           skip testing changeset
-e, --extend         extend the bisect range
-c, --command <CMD>  use command to check changeset state
-U, --noupdate       do not update to target

bookmarks
=========

create a new bookmark or list existing bookmarks::

   hg bookmarks [OPTIONS]... [NAME]...

Bookmarks are labels on changesets to help track lines of development.
Bookmarks are unversioned and can be moved, renamed and deleted.
Deleting or moving a bookmark has no effect on the associated changesets.

Creating or updating to a bookmark causes it to be marked as 'active'.
The active bookmark is indicated with a '*'.
When a commit is made, the active bookmark will advance to the new commit.
A plain :hg:`update` will also advance an active bookmark, if possible.
Updating away from a bookmark will cause it to be deactivated.

Bookmarks can be pushed and pulled between repositories (see
:hg:`help push` and :hg:`help pull`). If a shared bookmark has
diverged, a new 'divergent bookmark' of the form 'name@path' will
be created. Using :hg:`merge` will resolve the divergence.

A bookmark named '@' has the special property that :hg:`clone` will
check it out by default if it exists.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - create an active bookmark for a new line of development::

      hg book new-feature

  - create an inactive bookmark as a place marker::

      hg book -i reviewed

  - create an inactive bookmark on another changeset::

      hg book -r .^ tested

  - rename bookmark turkey to dinner::

      hg book -m turkey dinner

  - move the '@' bookmark from another branch::

      hg book -f @

Options:

-f, --force                force
-r, --rev <REV>            revision
-d, --delete               delete a given bookmark
-m, --rename <OLD>         rename a given bookmark
-i, --inactive             mark a bookmark inactive
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template (EXPERIMENTAL)

    aliases: bookmark

branch
======

set or show the current branch name::

   hg branch [-fC] [NAME]

.. note::

   Branch names are permanent and global. Use :hg:`bookmark` to create a
   light-weight bookmark instead. See :hg:`help glossary` for more
   information about named branches and bookmarks.

With no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument,
set the working directory branch name (the branch will not exist
in the repository until the next commit). Standard practice
recommends that primary development take place on the 'default'
branch.

Unless -f/--force is specified, branch will not let you set a
branch name that already exists.

Use -C/--clean to reset the working directory branch to that of
the parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch
change.

Use the command :hg:`update` to switch to an existing branch. Use
:hg:`commit --close-branch` to mark this branch head as closed.
When all heads of the branch are closed, the branch will be
considered closed.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-f, --force  set branch name even if it shadows an existing branch
-C, --clean  reset branch name to parent branch name

branches
========

list repository named branches::

   hg branches [-ac]

List the repository's named branches, indicating which ones are
inactive. If -c/--closed is specified, also list branches which have
been marked closed (see :hg:`commit --close-branch`).

Use the command :hg:`update` to switch to an existing branch.

Returns 0.

Options:

-a, --active               show only branches that have unmerged heads (DEPRECATED)
-c, --closed               show normal and closed branches
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template (EXPERIMENTAL)

bundle
======

create a changegroup file::

   hg bundle [-f] [-t TYPE] [-a] [-r REV]... [--base REV]... FILE [DEST]

Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting changesets not
known to be in another repository.

If you omit the destination repository, then hg assumes the
destination will have all the nodes you specify with --base
parameters. To create a bundle containing all changesets, use
-a/--all (or --base null).

You can change bundle format with the -t/--type option. You can
specify a compression, a bundle version or both using a dash
(comp-version). The available compression methods are: none, bzip2,
and gzip (by default, bundles are compressed using bzip2). The
available format are: v1, v2 (default to most suitable).

The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means
and applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull
command. This is useful when direct push and pull are not
available or when exporting an entire repository is undesirable.

Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including
permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if no changes found.

Options:

-f, --force               run even when the destination is unrelated
-r, --rev <REV[+]>        a changeset intended to be added to the destination
-b, --branch <BRANCH[+]>  a specific branch you would like to bundle
--base <REV[+]>           a base changeset assumed to be available at the destination
-a, --all                 bundle all changesets in the repository
-t, --type <TYPE>         bundle compression type to use (default: bzip2)
-e, --ssh <CMD>           specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>         specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure                do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

cat
===

output the current or given revision of files::

   hg cat [OPTION]... FILE...

Print the specified files as they were at the given revision. If
no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used.

Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
given using a format string. The formatting rules as follows:

:``%%``: literal "%" character
:``%s``: basename of file being printed
:``%d``: dirname of file being printed, or '.' if in repository root
:``%p``: root-relative path name of file being printed
:``%H``: changeset hash (40 hexadecimal digits)
:``%R``: changeset revision number
:``%h``: short-form changeset hash (12 hexadecimal digits)
:``%r``: zero-padded changeset revision number
:``%b``: basename of the exporting repository

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-o, --output <FORMAT>       print output to file with formatted name
-r, --rev <REV>             print the given revision
--decode                    apply any matching decode filter
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

clone
=====

make a copy of an existing repository::

   hg clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source.

The location of the source is added to the new repository's
``.hg/hgrc`` file, as the default to be used for future pulls.

Only local paths and ``ssh://`` URLs are supported as
destinations. For ``ssh://`` destinations, no working directory or
``.hg/hgrc`` will be created on the remote side.

To pull only a subset of changesets, specify one or more revisions
identifiers with -r/--rev or branches with -b/--branch. The
resulting clone will contain only the specified changesets and
their ancestors. These options (or 'clone src#rev dest') imply
--pull, even for local source repositories. Note that specifying a
tag will include the tagged changeset but not the changeset
containing the tag.

If the source repository has a bookmark called '@' set, that
revision will be checked out in the new repository by default.

To check out a particular version, use -u/--update, or
-U/--noupdate to create a clone with no working directory.

.. container:: verbose

  For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the
  source and destination are on the same filesystem (note this
  applies only to the repository data, not to the working
  directory). Some filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking
  incorrectly, but do not report errors. In these cases, use the
  --pull option to avoid hardlinking.

  In some cases, you can clone repositories and the working
  directory using full hardlinks with ::

    $ cp -al REPO REPOCLONE

  This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe. The
  operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during
  the operation is up to you) and you have to make sure your
  editor breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do
  so). Also, this is not compatible with certain extensions that
  place their metadata under the .hg directory, such as mq.

  Mercurial will update the working directory to the first applicable
  revision from this list:

  a) null if -U or the source repository has no changesets
  b) if -u . and the source repository is local, the first parent of
     the source repository's working directory
  c) the changeset specified with -u (if a branch name, this means the
     latest head of that branch)
  d) the changeset specified with -r
  e) the tipmost head specified with -b
  f) the tipmost head specified with the url#branch source syntax
  g) the revision marked with the '@' bookmark, if present
  h) the tipmost head of the default branch
  i) tip

  Examples:

  - clone a remote repository to a new directory named hg/::

      hg clone http://selenic.com/hg

  - create a lightweight local clone::

      hg clone project/ project-feature/

  - clone from an absolute path on an ssh server (note double-slash)::

      hg clone ssh://user@server//home/projects/alpha/

  - do a high-speed clone over a LAN while checking out a
    specified version::

      hg clone --uncompressed http://server/repo -u 1.5

  - create a repository without changesets after a particular revision::

      hg clone -r 04e544 experimental/ good/

  - clone (and track) a particular named branch::

      hg clone http://selenic.com/hg#stable

See :hg:`help urls` for details on specifying URLs.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-U, --noupdate            the clone will include an empty working directory (only a repository)
-u, --updaterev <REV>     revision, tag or branch to check out
-r, --rev <REV[+]>        include the specified changeset
-b, --branch <BRANCH[+]>  clone only the specified branch
--pull                    use pull protocol to copy metadata
--uncompressed            use uncompressed transfer (fast over LAN)
-e, --ssh <CMD>           specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>         specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure                do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

commit
======

commit the specified files or all outstanding changes::

   hg commit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Commit changes to the given files into the repository. Unlike a
centralized SCM, this operation is a local operation. See
:hg:`push` for a way to actively distribute your changes.

If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by :hg:`status`
will be committed.

If you are committing the result of a merge, do not provide any
filenames or -I/-X filters.

If no commit message is specified, Mercurial starts your
configured editor where you can enter a message. In case your
commit fails, you will find a backup of your message in
``.hg/last-message.txt``.

The --close-branch flag can be used to mark the current branch
head closed. When all heads of a branch are closed, the branch
will be considered closed and no longer listed.

The --amend flag can be used to amend the parent of the
working directory with a new commit that contains the changes
in the parent in addition to those currently reported by :hg:`status`,
if there are any. The old commit is stored in a backup bundle in
``.hg/strip-backup`` (see :hg:`help bundle` and :hg:`help unbundle`
on how to restore it).

Message, user and date are taken from the amended commit unless
specified. When a message isn't specified on the command line,
the editor will open with the message of the amended commit.

It is not possible to amend public changesets (see :hg:`help phases`)
or changesets that have children.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing changed.

Options:

-A, --addremove             mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing
--close-branch              mark a branch head as closed
--amend                     amend the parent of the working directory
-s, --secret                use the secret phase for committing
-e, --edit                  invoke editor on commit messages
-i, --interactive           use interactive mode
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message <TEXT>        use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>        read commit message from file

    aliases: ci

config
======

show combined config settings from all hgrc files::

   hg config [-u] [NAME]...

With no arguments, print names and values of all config items.

With one argument of the form section.name, print just the value
of that config item.

With multiple arguments, print names and values of all config
items with matching section names.

With --edit, start an editor on the user-level config file. With
--global, edit the system-wide config file. With --local, edit the
repository-level config file.

With --debug, the source (filename and line number) is printed
for each config item.

See :hg:`help config` for more information about config files.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if NAME does not exist.

Options:

-u, --untrusted  show untrusted configuration options
-e, --edit       edit user config
-l, --local      edit repository config
-g, --global     edit global config

    aliases: showconfig debugconfig

copy
====

mark files as copied for the next commit::

   hg copy [OPTION]... [SOURCE]... DEST

Mark dest as having copies of source files. If dest is a
directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file,
the source must be a single file.

By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
exist in the working directory. If invoked with -A/--after, the
operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.

This command takes effect with the next commit. To undo a copy
before that, see :hg:`revert`.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

Options:

-A, --after                 record a copy that has already occurred
-f, --force                 forcibly copy over an existing managed file
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns

diff
====

diff repository (or selected files)::

   hg diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [-r REV1 [-r REV2]]) [FILE]...

Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

.. note::

   diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will
   default to comparing against the working directory's first
   parent changeset if no revisions are specified.

When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
to its parent.

Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision to see
the changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.

Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of
files it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff
anyway, probably with undesirable results.

Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
format. For more information, read :hg:`help diffs`.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - compare a file in the current working directory to its parent::

      hg diff foo.c

  - compare two historical versions of a directory, with rename info::

      hg diff --git -r 1.0:1.2 lib/

  - get change stats relative to the last change on some date::

      hg diff --stat -r "date('may 2')"

  - diff all newly-added files that contain a keyword::

      hg diff "set:added() and grep(GNU)"

  - compare a revision and its parents::

      hg diff -c 9353         # compare against first parent
      hg diff -r 9353^:9353   # same using revset syntax
      hg diff -r 9353^2:9353  # compare against the second parent

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV[+]>          revision
-c, --change <REV>          change made by revision
-a, --text                  treat all files as text
-g, --git                   use git extended diff format
--nodates                   omit dates from diff headers
--noprefix                  omit a/ and b/ prefixes from filenames
-p, --show-function         show which function each change is in
--reverse                   produce a diff that undoes the changes
-w, --ignore-all-space      ignore white space when comparing lines
-b, --ignore-space-change   ignore changes in the amount of white space
-B, --ignore-blank-lines    ignore changes whose lines are all blank
-U, --unified <NUM>         number of lines of context to show
--stat                      output diffstat-style summary of changes
--root <DIR>                produce diffs relative to subdirectory
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

export
======

dump the header and diffs for one or more changesets::

   hg export [OPTION]... [-o OUTFILESPEC] [-r] [REV]...

Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.
If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used.

The information shown in the changeset header is: author, date,
branch name (if non-default), changeset hash, parent(s) and commit
comment.

.. note::

   export may generate unexpected diff output for merge
   changesets, as it will compare the merge changeset against its
   first parent only.

Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
given using a format string. The formatting rules are as follows:

:``%%``: literal "%" character
:``%H``: changeset hash (40 hexadecimal digits)
:``%N``: number of patches being generated
:``%R``: changeset revision number
:``%b``: basename of the exporting repository
:``%h``: short-form changeset hash (12 hexadecimal digits)
:``%m``: first line of the commit message (only alphanumeric characters)
:``%n``: zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1
:``%r``: zero-padded changeset revision number

Without the -a/--text option, export will avoid generating diffs
of files it detects as binary. With -a, export will generate a
diff anyway, probably with undesirable results.

Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
format. See :hg:`help diffs` for more information.

With the --switch-parent option, the diff will be against the
second parent. It can be useful to review a merge.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - use export and import to transplant a bugfix to the current
    branch::

      hg export -r 9353 | hg import -

  - export all the changesets between two revisions to a file with
    rename information::

      hg export --git -r 123:150 > changes.txt

  - split outgoing changes into a series of patches with
    descriptive names::

      hg export -r "outgoing()" -o "%n-%m.patch"

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-o, --output <FORMAT>  print output to file with formatted name
--switch-parent        diff against the second parent
-r, --rev <REV[+]>     revisions to export
-a, --text             treat all files as text
-g, --git              use git extended diff format
--nodates              omit dates from diff headers

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

files
=====

list tracked files::

   hg files [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...

Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory or
specified revision whose names match the given patterns (excluding
removed files).

If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names
of all files under Mercurial control in the working directory.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - list all files under the current directory::

      hg files .

  - shows sizes and flags for current revision::

      hg files -vr .

  - list all files named README::

      hg files -I "**/README"

  - list all binary files::

      hg files "set:binary()"

  - find files containing a regular expression::

      hg files "set:grep('bob')"

  - search tracked file contents with xargs and grep::

      hg files -0 | xargs -0 grep foo

See :hg:`help patterns` and :hg:`help filesets` for more information
on specifying file patterns.

Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV>             search the repository as it is in REV
-0, --print0                end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>   display with template (EXPERIMENTAL)
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

forget
======

forget the specified files on the next commit::

   hg forget [OPTION]... FILE...

Mark the specified files so they will no longer be tracked
after the next commit.

This only removes files from the current branch, not from the
entire project history, and it does not delete them from the
working directory.

To delete the file from the working directory, see :hg:`remove`.

To undo a forget before the next commit, see :hg:`add`.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - forget newly-added binary files::

      hg forget "set:added() and binary()"

  - forget files that would be excluded by .hgignore::

      hg forget "set:hgignore()"

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

graft
=====

copy changes from other branches onto the current branch::

   hg graft [OPTION]... [-r] REV...

This command uses Mercurial's merge logic to copy individual
changes from other branches without merging branches in the
history graph. This is sometimes known as 'backporting' or
'cherry-picking'. By default, graft will copy user, date, and
description from the source changesets.

Changesets that are ancestors of the current revision, that have
already been grafted, or that are merges will be skipped.

If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended
of the form::

  (grafted from CHANGESETHASH)

If --force is specified, revisions will be grafted even if they
are already ancestors of or have been grafted to the destination.
This is useful when the revisions have since been backed out.

If a graft merge results in conflicts, the graft process is
interrupted so that the current merge can be manually resolved.
Once all conflicts are addressed, the graft process can be
continued with the -c/--continue option.

.. note::

  The -c/--continue option does not reapply earlier options, except
  for --force.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - copy a single change to the stable branch and edit its description::

      hg update stable
      hg graft --edit 9393

  - graft a range of changesets with one exception, updating dates::

      hg graft -D "2085::2093 and not 2091"

  - continue a graft after resolving conflicts::

      hg graft -c

  - show the source of a grafted changeset::

      hg log --debug -r .

See :hg:`help revisions` and :hg:`help revsets` for more about
specifying revisions.

Returns 0 on successful completion.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV[+]>  revisions to graft
-c, --continue      resume interrupted graft
-e, --edit          invoke editor on commit messages
--log               append graft info to log message
-f, --force         force graft
-D, --currentdate   record the current date as commit date
-U, --currentuser   record the current user as committer
-d, --date <DATE>   record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>   record the specified user as committer
-t, --tool <VALUE>  specify merge tool
-n, --dry-run       do not perform actions, just print output

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

grep
====

search for a pattern in specified files and revisions::

   hg grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...

Search revisions of files for a regular expression.

This command behaves differently than Unix grep. It only accepts
Python/Perl regexps. It searches repository history, not the
working directory. It always prints the revision number in which a
match appears.

By default, grep only prints output for the first revision of a
file in which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision
that contains a change in match status ("-" for a match that
becomes a non-match, or "+" for a non-match that becomes a match),
use the --all flag.

Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

Options:

-0, --print0                end fields with NUL
--all                       print all revisions that match
-a, --text                  treat all files as text
-f, --follow                follow changeset history, or file history across copies and renames
-i, --ignore-case           ignore case when matching
-l, --files-with-matches    print only filenames and revisions that match
-n, --line-number           print matching line numbers
-r, --rev <REV[+]>          only search files changed within revision range
-u, --user                  list the author (long with -v)
-d, --date                  list the date (short with -q)
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

heads
=====

show branch heads::

   hg heads [-ct] [-r STARTREV] [REV]...

With no arguments, show all open branch heads in the repository.
Branch heads are changesets that have no descendants on the
same branch. They are where development generally takes place and
are the usual targets for update and merge operations.

If one or more REVs are given, only open branch heads on the
branches associated with the specified changesets are shown. This
means that you can use :hg:`heads .` to see the heads on the
currently checked-out branch.

If -c/--closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed
(see :hg:`commit --close-branch`).

If STARTREV is specified, only those heads that are descendants of
STARTREV will be displayed.

If -t/--topo is specified, named branch mechanics will be ignored and only
topological heads (changesets with no children) will be shown.

Returns 0 if matching heads are found, 1 if not.

Options:

-r, --rev <STARTREV>       show only heads which are descendants of STARTREV
-t, --topo                 show topological heads only
-a, --active               show active branchheads only (DEPRECATED)
-c, --closed               show normal and closed branch heads
--style <STYLE>            display using template map file (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template

help
====

show help for a given topic or a help overview::

   hg help [-eck] [TOPIC]

With no arguments, print a list of commands with short help messages.

Given a topic, extension, or command name, print help for that
topic.

Returns 0 if successful.

Options:

-e, --extension  show only help for extensions
-c, --command    show only help for commands
-k, --keyword    show topics matching keyword

identify
========

identify the working directory or specified revision::

   hg identify [-nibtB] [-r REV] [SOURCE]

Print a summary identifying the repository state at REV using one or
two parent hash identifiers, followed by a "+" if the working
directory has uncommitted changes, the branch name (if not default),
a list of tags, and a list of bookmarks.

When REV is not given, print a summary of the current state of the
repository.

Specifying a path to a repository root or Mercurial bundle will
cause lookup to operate on that repository/bundle.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - generate a build identifier for the working directory::

      hg id --id > build-id.dat

  - find the revision corresponding to a tag::

      hg id -n -r 1.3

  - check the most recent revision of a remote repository::

      hg id -r tip http://selenic.com/hg/

Returns 0 if successful.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV>    identify the specified revision
-n, --num          show local revision number
-i, --id           show global revision id
-b, --branch       show branch
-t, --tags         show tags
-B, --bookmarks    show bookmarks
-e, --ssh <CMD>    specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>  specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure         do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

    aliases: id

import
======

import an ordered set of patches::

   hg import [OPTION]... PATCH...

Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless
--no-commit is specified).

Because import first applies changes to the working directory,
import will abort if there are outstanding changes.

You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches
as attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type
text/plain or text/x-patch). From and Subject headers of email
message are used as default committer and commit message. All
text/plain body parts before first diff are added to commit
message.

If the imported patch was generated by :hg:`export`, user and
description from patch override values from message headers and
body. Values given on command line with -m/--message and -u/--user
override these.

If --exact is specified, import will set the working directory to
the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the
resulting changeset has a different ID than the one recorded in
the patch. This may happen due to character set problems or other
deficiencies in the text patch format.

Use --bypass to apply and commit patches directly to the
repository, not touching the working directory. Without --exact,
patches will be applied on top of the working directory parent
revision.

With -s/--similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and
copies in the patch in the same way as :hg:`addremove`.

Use --partial to ensure a changeset will be created from the patch
even if some hunks fail to apply. Hunks that fail to apply will be
written to a <target-file>.rej file. Conflicts can then be resolved
by hand before :hg:`commit --amend` is run to update the created
changeset. This flag exists to let people import patches that
partially apply without losing the associated metadata (author,
date, description, ...). Note that when none of the hunk applies
cleanly, :hg:`import --partial` will create an empty changeset,
importing only the patch metadata.

It is possible to use external patch programs to perform the patch
by setting the ``ui.patch`` configuration option. For the default
internal tool, the fuzz can also be configured via ``patch.fuzz``.
See :hg:`help config` for more information about configuration
files and how to use these options.

To read a patch from standard input, use "-" as the patch name. If
a URL is specified, the patch will be downloaded from it.
See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - import a traditional patch from a website and detect renames::

      hg import -s 80 http://example.com/bugfix.patch

  - import a changeset from an hgweb server::

      hg import http://www.selenic.com/hg/rev/5ca8c111e9aa

  - import all the patches in an Unix-style mbox::

      hg import incoming-patches.mbox

  - attempt to exactly restore an exported changeset (not always
    possible)::

      hg import --exact proposed-fix.patch

  - use an external tool to apply a patch which is too fuzzy for
    the default internal tool.

      hg import --config ui.patch="patch --merge" fuzzy.patch

  - change the default fuzzing from 2 to a less strict 7

      hg import --config ui.fuzz=7 fuzz.patch

Returns 0 on success, 1 on partial success (see --partial).

Options:

-p, --strip <NUM>              directory strip option for patch. This has the same meaning as the corresponding patch option (default: 1)
-b, --base <PATH>              base path (DEPRECATED)
-e, --edit                     invoke editor on commit messages
-f, --force                    skip check for outstanding uncommitted changes (DEPRECATED)
--no-commit                    don't commit, just update the working directory
--bypass                       apply patch without touching the working directory
--partial                      commit even if some hunks fail
--exact                        apply patch to the nodes from which it was generated
--prefix <DIR>                 apply patch to subdirectory
--import-branch                use any branch information in patch (implied by --exact)
-m, --message <TEXT>           use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>           read commit message from file
-d, --date <DATE>              record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>              record the specified user as committer
-s, --similarity <SIMILARITY>  guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)

    aliases: patch

incoming
========

show new changesets found in source::

   hg incoming [-p] [-n] [-M] [-f] [-r REV]... [--bundle FILENAME] [SOURCE]

Show new changesets found in the specified path/URL or the default
pull location. These are the changesets that would have been pulled
if a pull at the time you issued this command.

See pull for valid source format details.

.. container:: verbose

  With -B/--bookmarks, the result of bookmark comparison between
  local and remote repositories is displayed. With -v/--verbose,
  status is also displayed for each bookmark like below::

    BM1               01234567890a added
    BM2               1234567890ab advanced
    BM3               234567890abc diverged
    BM4               34567890abcd changed

  The action taken locally when pulling depends on the
  status of each bookmark:

  :``added``: pull will create it
  :``advanced``: pull will update it
  :``diverged``: pull will create a divergent bookmark
  :``changed``: result depends on remote changesets

  From the point of view of pulling behavior, bookmark
  existing only in the remote repository are treated as ``added``,
  even if it is in fact locally deleted.

.. container:: verbose

  For remote repository, using --bundle avoids downloading the
  changesets twice if the incoming is followed by a pull.

  Examples:

  - show incoming changes with patches and full description::

      hg incoming -vp

  - show incoming changes excluding merges, store a bundle::

      hg in -vpM --bundle incoming.hg
      hg pull incoming.hg

  - briefly list changes inside a bundle::

      hg in changes.hg -T "{desc|firstline}\n"

Returns 0 if there are incoming changes, 1 otherwise.

Options:

-f, --force                run even if remote repository is unrelated
-n, --newest-first         show newest record first
--bundle <FILE>            file to store the bundles into
-r, --rev <REV[+]>         a remote changeset intended to be added
-B, --bookmarks            compare bookmarks
-b, --branch <BRANCH[+]>   a specific branch you would like to pull
-p, --patch                show patch
-g, --git                  use git extended diff format
-l, --limit <NUM>          limit number of changes displayed
-M, --no-merges            do not show merges
--stat                     output diffstat-style summary of changes
-G, --graph                show the revision DAG
--style <STYLE>            display using template map file (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template
-e, --ssh <CMD>            specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>          specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure                 do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)
-S, --subrepos             recurse into subrepositories

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

    aliases: in

init
====

create a new repository in the given directory::

   hg init [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]

Initialize a new repository in the given directory. If the given
directory does not exist, it will be created.

If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

It is possible to specify an ``ssh://`` URL as the destination.
See :hg:`help urls` for more information.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-e, --ssh <CMD>    specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>  specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure         do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

locate
======

locate files matching specific patterns (DEPRECATED)::

   hg locate [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...

Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory whose
names match the given patterns.

By default, this command searches all directories in the working
directory. To search just the current directory and its
subdirectories, use "--include .".

If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names
of all files under Mercurial control in the working directory.

If you want to feed the output of this command into the "xargs"
command, use the -0 option to both this command and "xargs". This
will avoid the problem of "xargs" treating single filenames that
contain whitespace as multiple filenames.

See :hg:`help files` for a more versatile command.

Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV>             search the repository as it is in REV
-0, --print0                end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
-f, --fullpath              print complete paths from the filesystem root
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

log
===

show revision history of entire repository or files::

   hg log [OPTION]... [FILE]

Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire
project.

If no revision range is specified, the default is ``tip:0`` unless
--follow is set, in which case the working directory parent is
used as the starting revision.

File history is shown without following rename or copy history of
files. Use -f/--follow with a filename to follow history across
renames and copies. --follow without a filename will only show
ancestors or descendants of the starting revision.

By default this command prints revision number and changeset id,
tags, non-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for
each commit. When the -v/--verbose switch is used, the list of
changed files and full commit message are shown.

With --graph the revisions are shown as an ASCII art DAG with the most
recent changeset at the top.
'o' is a changeset, '@' is a working directory parent, 'x' is obsolete,
and '+' represents a fork where the changeset from the lines below is a
parent of the 'o' merge on the same line.

.. note::

   log -p/--patch may generate unexpected diff output for merge
   changesets, as it will only compare the merge changeset against
   its first parent. Also, only files different from BOTH parents
   will appear in files:.

.. note::

   for performance reasons, log FILE may omit duplicate changes
   made on branches and will not show removals or mode changes. To
   see all such changes, use the --removed switch.

.. container:: verbose

  Some examples:

  - changesets with full descriptions and file lists::

      hg log -v

  - changesets ancestral to the working directory::

      hg log -f

  - last 10 commits on the current branch::

      hg log -l 10 -b .

  - changesets showing all modifications of a file, including removals::

      hg log --removed file.c

  - all changesets that touch a directory, with diffs, excluding merges::

      hg log -Mp lib/

  - all revision numbers that match a keyword::

      hg log -k bug --template "{rev}\n"

    aliases: history

manifest
========

output the current or given revision of the project manifest::

   hg manifest [-r REV]

Print a list of version controlled files for the given revision.
If no revision is given, the first parent of the working directory
is used, or the null revision if no revision is checked out.

With -v, print file permissions, symlink and executable bits.
With --debug, print file revision hashes.

If option --all is specified, the list of all files from all revisions
is printed. This includes deleted and renamed files.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV>            revision to display
--all                      list files from all revisions
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template (EXPERIMENTAL)

merge
=====

merge another revision into working directory::

   hg merge [-P] [-f] [[-r] REV]

The current working directory is updated with all changes made in
the requested revision since the last common predecessor revision.

Files that changed between either parent are marked as changed for
the next commit and a commit must be performed before any further
updates to the repository are allowed. The next commit will have
two parents.

``--tool`` can be used to specify the merge tool used for file
merges. It overrides the HGMERGE environment variable and your
configuration files. See :hg:`help merge-tools` for options.

If no revision is specified, the working directory's parent is a
head revision, and the current branch contains exactly one other
head, the other head is merged with by default. Otherwise, an
explicit revision with which to merge with must be provided.

:hg:`resolve` must be used to resolve unresolved files.

To undo an uncommitted merge, use :hg:`update --clean .` which
will check out a clean copy of the original merge parent, losing
all changes.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

Options:

-f, --force         force a merge including outstanding changes (DEPRECATED)
-r, --rev <REV>     revision to merge
-P, --preview       review revisions to merge (no merge is performed)
-t, --tool <VALUE>  specify merge tool

outgoing
========

show changesets not found in the destination::

   hg outgoing [-M] [-p] [-n] [-f] [-r REV]... [DEST]

Show changesets not found in the specified destination repository
or the default push location. These are the changesets that would
be pushed if a push was requested.

See pull for details of valid destination formats.

.. container:: verbose

  With -B/--bookmarks, the result of bookmark comparison between
  local and remote repositories is displayed. With -v/--verbose,
  status is also displayed for each bookmark like below::

    BM1               01234567890a added
    BM2                            deleted
    BM3               234567890abc advanced
    BM4               34567890abcd diverged
    BM5               4567890abcde changed

  The action taken when pushing depends on the
  status of each bookmark:

  :``added``: push with ``-B`` will create it
  :``deleted``: push with ``-B`` will delete it
  :``advanced``: push will update it
  :``diverged``: push with ``-B`` will update it
  :``changed``: push with ``-B`` will update it

  From the point of view of pushing behavior, bookmarks
  existing only in the remote repository are treated as
  ``deleted``, even if it is in fact added remotely.

Returns 0 if there are outgoing changes, 1 otherwise.

Options:

-f, --force                run even when the destination is unrelated
-r, --rev <REV[+]>         a changeset intended to be included in the destination
-n, --newest-first         show newest record first
-B, --bookmarks            compare bookmarks
-b, --branch <BRANCH[+]>   a specific branch you would like to push
-p, --patch                show patch
-g, --git                  use git extended diff format
-l, --limit <NUM>          limit number of changes displayed
-M, --no-merges            do not show merges
--stat                     output diffstat-style summary of changes
-G, --graph                show the revision DAG
--style <STYLE>            display using template map file (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template
-e, --ssh <CMD>            specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>          specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure                 do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)
-S, --subrepos             recurse into subrepositories

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

    aliases: out

parents
=======

show the parents of the working directory or revision (DEPRECATED)::

   hg parents [-r REV] [FILE]

Print the working directory's parent revisions. If a revision is
given via -r/--rev, the parent of that revision will be printed.
If a file argument is given, the revision in which the file was
last changed (before the working directory revision or the
argument to --rev if given) is printed.

See :hg:`summary` and :hg:`help revsets` for related information.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV>            show parents of the specified revision
--style <STYLE>            display using template map file (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template

paths
=====

show aliases for remote repositories::

   hg paths [NAME]

Show definition of symbolic path name NAME. If no name is given,
show definition of all available names.

Option -q/--quiet suppresses all output when searching for NAME
and shows only the path names when listing all definitions.

Path names are defined in the [paths] section of your
configuration file and in ``/etc/mercurial/hgrc``. If run inside a
repository, ``.hg/hgrc`` is used, too.

The path names ``default`` and ``default-push`` have a special
meaning.  When performing a push or pull operation, they are used
as fallbacks if no location is specified on the command-line.
When ``default-push`` is set, it will be used for push and
``default`` will be used for pull; otherwise ``default`` is used
as the fallback for both.  When cloning a repository, the clone
source is written as ``default`` in ``.hg/hgrc``.  Note that
``default`` and ``default-push`` apply to all inbound (e.g.
:hg:`incoming`) and outbound (e.g. :hg:`outgoing`, :hg:`email` and
:hg:`bundle`) operations.

See :hg:`help urls` for more information.

Returns 0 on success.

phase
=====

set or show the current phase name::

   hg phase [-p|-d|-s] [-f] [-r] [REV...]

With no argument, show the phase name of the current revision(s).

With one of -p/--public, -d/--draft or -s/--secret, change the
phase value of the specified revisions.

Unless -f/--force is specified, :hg:`phase` won't move changeset from a
lower phase to an higher phase. Phases are ordered as follows::

    public < draft < secret

Returns 0 on success, 1 if some phases could not be changed.

(For more information about the phases concept, see :hg:`help phases`.)

Options:

-p, --public        set changeset phase to public
-d, --draft         set changeset phase to draft
-s, --secret        set changeset phase to secret
-f, --force         allow to move boundary backward
-r, --rev <REV[+]>  target revision

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

pull
====

pull changes from the specified source::

   hg pull [-u] [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]

Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
or URL and adds them to a local repository (the current one unless
-R is specified). By default, this does not update the copy of the
project in the working directory.

Use :hg:`incoming` if you want to see what would have been added
by a pull at the time you issued this command. If you then decide
to add those changes to the repository, you should use :hg:`pull
-r X` where ``X`` is the last changeset listed by :hg:`incoming`.

If SOURCE is omitted, the 'default' path will be used.
See :hg:`help urls` for more information.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update had unresolved files.

Options:

-u, --update                  update to new branch head if changesets were pulled
-f, --force                   run even when remote repository is unrelated
-r, --rev <REV[+]>            a remote changeset intended to be added
-B, --bookmark <BOOKMARK[+]>  bookmark to pull
-b, --branch <BRANCH[+]>      a specific branch you would like to pull
-e, --ssh <CMD>               specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>             specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure                    do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

push
====

push changes to the specified destination::

   hg push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]

Push changesets from the local repository to the specified
destination.

This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull
in the destination repository from the current one.

By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the
destination, since multiple heads would make it unclear which head
to use. In this situation, it is recommended to pull and merge
before pushing.

Use --new-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named
branch that is not present at the destination. This allows you to
only create a new branch without forcing other changes.

.. note::

  Extra care should be taken with the -f/--force option,
  which will push all new heads on all branches, an action which will
  almost always cause confusion for collaborators.

If -r/--rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors
will be pushed to the remote repository.

If -B/--bookmark is used, the specified bookmarked revision, its
ancestors, and the bookmark will be pushed to the remote
repository.

Please see :hg:`help urls` for important details about ``ssh://``
URLs. If DESTINATION is omitted, a default path will be used.

Returns 0 if push was successful, 1 if nothing to push.

Options:

-f, --force                   force push
-r, --rev <REV[+]>            a changeset intended to be included in the destination
-B, --bookmark <BOOKMARK[+]>  bookmark to push
-b, --branch <BRANCH[+]>      a specific branch you would like to push
--new-branch                  allow pushing a new branch
-e, --ssh <CMD>               specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>             specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure                    do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

recover
=======

roll back an interrupted transaction::

   hg recover

Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.

This command tries to fix the repository status after an
interrupted operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial
suggests it.

Returns 0 if successful, 1 if nothing to recover or verify fails.

remove
======

remove the specified files on the next commit::

   hg remove [OPTION]... FILE...

Schedule the indicated files for removal from the current branch.

This command schedules the files to be removed at the next commit.
To undo a remove before that, see :hg:`revert`. To undo added
files, see :hg:`forget`.

.. container:: verbose

  -A/--after can be used to remove only files that have already
  been deleted, -f/--force can be used to force deletion, and -Af
  can be used to remove files from the next revision without
  deleting them from the working directory.

  The following table details the behavior of remove for different
  file states (columns) and option combinations (rows). The file
  states are Added [A], Clean [C], Modified [M] and Missing [!]
  (as reported by :hg:`status`). The actions are Warn, Remove
  (from branch) and Delete (from disk):

  ========= == == == ==
  opt/state A  C  M  !
  ========= == == == ==
  none      W  RD W  R
  -f        R  RD RD R
  -A        W  W  W  R
  -Af       R  R  R  R
  ========= == == == ==

  Note that remove never deletes files in Added [A] state from the
  working directory, not even if option --force is specified.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if any warnings encountered.

Options:

-A, --after                 record delete for missing files
-f, --force                 remove (and delete) file even if added or modified
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

    aliases: rm

rename
======

rename files; equivalent of copy + remove::

   hg rename [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST

Mark dest as copies of sources; mark sources for deletion. If dest
is a directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a
file, there can only be one source.

By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
exist in the working directory. If invoked with -A/--after, the
operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.

This command takes effect at the next commit. To undo a rename
before that, see :hg:`revert`.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

Options:

-A, --after                 record a rename that has already occurred
-f, --force                 forcibly copy over an existing managed file
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-n, --dry-run               do not perform actions, just print output

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

    aliases: move mv

resolve
=======

redo merges or set/view the merge status of files::

   hg resolve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Merges with unresolved conflicts are often the result of
non-interactive merging using the ``internal:merge`` configuration
setting, or a command-line merge tool like ``diff3``. The resolve
command is used to manage the files involved in a merge, after
:hg:`merge` has been run, and before :hg:`commit` is run (i.e. the
working directory must have two parents). See :hg:`help
merge-tools` for information on configuring merge tools.

The resolve command can be used in the following ways:

- :hg:`resolve [--tool TOOL] FILE...`: attempt to re-merge the specified
  files, discarding any previous merge attempts. Re-merging is not
  performed for files already marked as resolved. Use ``--all/-a``
  to select all unresolved files. ``--tool`` can be used to specify
  the merge tool used for the given files. It overrides the HGMERGE
  environment variable and your configuration files.  Previous file
  contents are saved with a ``.orig`` suffix.

- :hg:`resolve -m [FILE]`: mark a file as having been resolved
  (e.g. after having manually fixed-up the files). The default is
  to mark all unresolved files.

- :hg:`resolve -u [FILE]...`: mark a file as unresolved. The
  default is to mark all resolved files.

- :hg:`resolve -l`: list files which had or still have conflicts.
  In the printed list, ``U`` = unresolved and ``R`` = resolved.

Note that Mercurial will not let you commit files with unresolved
merge conflicts. You must use :hg:`resolve -m ...` before you can
commit after a conflicting merge.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if any files fail a resolve attempt.

Options:

-a, --all                   select all unresolved files
-l, --list                  list state of files needing merge
-m, --mark                  mark files as resolved
-u, --unmark                mark files as unresolved
-n, --no-status             hide status prefix
-t, --tool <VALUE>          specify merge tool
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>   display with template (EXPERIMENTAL)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

revert
======

restore files to their checkout state::

   hg revert [OPTION]... [-r REV] [NAME]...

.. note::

   To check out earlier revisions, you should use :hg:`update REV`.
   To cancel an uncommitted merge (and lose your changes),
   use :hg:`update --clean .`.

With no revision specified, revert the specified files or directories
to the contents they had in the parent of the working directory.
This restores the contents of files to an unmodified
state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the
working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify a
revision.

Using the -r/--rev or -d/--date options, revert the given files or
directories to their states as of a specific revision. Because
revert does not change the working directory parents, this will
cause these files to appear modified. This can be helpful to "back
out" some or all of an earlier change. See :hg:`backout` for a
related method.

Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.
To disable these backups, use --no-backup.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

See :hg:`help backout` for a way to reverse the effect of an
earlier changeset.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-a, --all                   revert all changes when no arguments given
-d, --date <DATE>           tipmost revision matching date
-r, --rev <REV>             revert to the specified revision
-C, --no-backup             do not save backup copies of files
-i, --interactive           interactively select the changes (EXPERIMENTAL)
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-n, --dry-run               do not perform actions, just print output

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

rollback
========

roll back the last transaction (DANGEROUS) (DEPRECATED)::

   hg rollback

Please use :hg:`commit --amend` instead of rollback to correct
mistakes in the last commit.

This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also
restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing
any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter
the working directory.

Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands
that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a
repository.

.. container:: verbose

  For example, the following commands are transactional, and their
  effects can be rolled back:

  - commit
  - import
  - pull
  - push (with this repository as the destination)
  - unbundle

  To avoid permanent data loss, rollback will refuse to rollback a
  commit transaction if it isn't checked out. Use --force to
  override this protection.

This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction
back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled
the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the
repository; for example an in-progress pull from the repository
may fail if a rollback is performed.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

Options:

-n, --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output
-f, --force    ignore safety measures

root
====

print the root (top) of the current working directory::

   hg root

Print the root directory of the current repository.

Returns 0 on success.

serve
=====

start stand-alone webserver::

   hg serve [OPTION]...

Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can use
this for ad-hoc sharing and browsing of repositories. It is
recommended to use a real web server to serve a repository for
longer periods of time.

Please note that the server does not implement access control.
This means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and
nobody can write to it by default. Set the ``web.allow_push``
option to ``*`` to allow everybody to push to the server. You
should use a real web server if you need to authenticate users.

By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to
stderr. Use the -A/--accesslog and -E/--errorlog options to log to
files.

To have the server choose a free port number to listen on, specify
a port number of 0; in this case, the server will print the port
number it uses.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-A, --accesslog <FILE>      name of access log file to write to
-d, --daemon                run server in background
--daemon-pipefds <FILE>     used internally by daemon mode
-E, --errorlog <FILE>       name of error log file to write to
-p, --port <PORT>           port to listen on (default: 8000)
-a, --address <ADDR>        address to listen on (default: all interfaces)
--prefix <PREFIX>           prefix path to serve from (default: server root)
-n, --name <NAME>           name to show in web pages (default: working directory)
--web-conf <FILE>           name of the hgweb config file (see "hg help hgweb")
--webdir-conf <FILE>        name of the hgweb config file (DEPRECATED)
--pid-file <FILE>           name of file to write process ID to
--stdio                     for remote clients
--cmdserver <MODE>          for remote clients
-t, --templates <TEMPLATE>  web templates to use
--style <STYLE>             template style to use
-6, --ipv6                  use IPv6 in addition to IPv4
--certificate <FILE>        SSL certificate file

status
======

show changed files in the working directory::

   hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Show status of files in the repository. If names are given, only
files that match are shown. Files that are clean or ignored or
the source of a copy/move operation, are not listed unless
-c/--clean, -i/--ignored, -C/--copies or -A/--all are given.
Unless options described with "show only ..." are given, the
options -mardu are used.

Option -q/--quiet hides untracked (unknown and ignored) files
unless explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or -i/--ignored.

.. note::

   status may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have
   changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does
   not report permission changes and diff only reports changes
   relative to one merge parent.

If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision.
If two revisions are given, the differences between them are
shown. The --change option can also be used as a shortcut to list
the changed files of a revision from its first parent.

The codes used to show the status of files are::

  M = modified
  A = added
  R = removed
  C = clean
  ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
  ? = not tracked
  I = ignored
    = origin of the previous file (with --copies)

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - show changes in the working directory relative to a
    changeset::

      hg status --rev 9353

  - show changes in the working directory relative to the
    current directory (see :hg:`help patterns` for more information)::

      hg status re:

  - show all changes including copies in an existing changeset::

      hg status --copies --change 9353

  - get a NUL separated list of added files, suitable for xargs::

      hg status -an0

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-A, --all                   show status of all files
-m, --modified              show only modified files
-a, --added                 show only added files
-r, --removed               show only removed files

    aliases: st

summary
=======

summarize working directory state::

   hg summary [--remote]

This generates a brief summary of the working directory state,
including parents, branch, commit status, phase and available updates.

With the --remote option, this will check the default paths for
incoming and outgoing changes. This can be time-consuming.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

--remote  check for push and pull

    aliases: sum

tag
===

add one or more tags for the current or given revision::

   hg tag [-f] [-l] [-m TEXT] [-d DATE] [-u USER] [-r REV] NAME...

Name a particular revision using <name>.

Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant
earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc. Changing
an existing tag is normally disallowed; use -f/--force to override.

If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
used.

To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed similarly
to other project files and can be hand-edited if necessary. This
also means that tagging creates a new commit. The file
".hg/localtags" is used for local tags (not shared among
repositories).

Tag commits are usually made at the head of a branch. If the parent
of the working directory is not a branch head, :hg:`tag` aborts; use
-f/--force to force the tag commit to be based on a non-head
changeset.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

Since tag names have priority over branch names during revision
lookup, using an existing branch name as a tag name is discouraged.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-f, --force           force tag
-l, --local           make the tag local
-r, --rev <REV>       revision to tag
--remove              remove a tag
-e, --edit            invoke editor on commit messages
-m, --message <TEXT>  use text as commit message
-d, --date <DATE>     record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>     record the specified user as committer

tags
====

list repository tags::

   hg tags

This lists both regular and local tags. When the -v/--verbose
switch is used, a third column "local" is printed for local tags.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template (EXPERIMENTAL)

tip
===

show the tip revision (DEPRECATED)::

   hg tip [-p] [-g]

The tip revision (usually just called the tip) is the changeset
most recently added to the repository (and therefore the most
recently changed head).

If you have just made a commit, that commit will be the tip. If
you have just pulled changes from another repository, the tip of
that repository becomes the current tip. The "tip" tag is special
and cannot be renamed or assigned to a different changeset.

This command is deprecated, please use :hg:`heads` instead.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-p, --patch                show patch
-g, --git                  use git extended diff format
--style <STYLE>            display using template map file (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template

unbundle
========

apply one or more changegroup files::

   hg unbundle [-u] FILE...

Apply one or more compressed changegroup files generated by the
bundle command.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update has unresolved files.

Options:

-u, --update  update to new branch head if changesets were unbundled

update
======

update working directory (or switch revisions)::

   hg update [-c] [-C] [-d DATE] [[-r] REV]

Update the repository's working directory to the specified
changeset. If no changeset is specified, update to the tip of the
current named branch and move the active bookmark (see :hg:`help
bookmarks`).

Update sets the working directory's parent revision to the specified
changeset (see :hg:`help parents`).

If the changeset is not a descendant or ancestor of the working
directory's parent, the update is aborted. With the -c/--check
option, the working directory is checked for uncommitted changes; if
none are found, the working directory is updated to the specified
changeset.

.. container:: verbose

  The following rules apply when the working directory contains
  uncommitted changes:

  1. If neither -c/--check nor -C/--clean is specified, and if
     the requested changeset is an ancestor or descendant of
     the working directory's parent, the uncommitted changes
     are merged into the requested changeset and the merged
     result is left uncommitted. If the requested changeset is
     not an ancestor or descendant (that is, it is on another
     branch), the update is aborted and the uncommitted changes
     are preserved.

  2. With the -c/--check option, the update is aborted and the
     uncommitted changes are preserved.

  3. With the -C/--clean option, uncommitted changes are discarded and
     the working directory is updated to the requested changeset.

To cancel an uncommitted merge (and lose your changes), use
:hg:`update --clean .`.

Use null as the changeset to remove the working directory (like
:hg:`clone -U`).

If you want to revert just one file to an older revision, use
:hg:`revert [-r REV] NAME`.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

Options:

-C, --clean         discard uncommitted changes (no backup)
-c, --check         update across branches if no uncommitted changes
-d, --date <DATE>   tipmost revision matching date
-r, --rev <REV>     revision
-t, --tool <VALUE>  specify merge tool

    aliases: up checkout co

verify
======

verify the integrity of the repository::

   hg verify

Verify the integrity of the current repository.

This will perform an extensive check of the repository's
integrity, validating the hashes and checksums of each entry in
the changelog, manifest, and tracked files, as well as the
integrity of their crosslinks and indices.

Please see https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RepositoryCorruption
for more information about recovery from corruption of the
repository.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

.. _dates:

Date Formats
""""""""""""

Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:

- backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.
- log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.

Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:

- ``Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006`` (local timezone assumed)
- ``Dec 6 13:18 -0600`` (year assumed, time offset provided)
- ``Dec 6 13:18 UTC`` (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)
- ``Dec 6`` (midnight)
- ``13:18`` (today assumed)
- ``3:39`` (3:39AM assumed)
- ``3:39pm`` (15:39)
- ``2006-12-06 13:18:29`` (ISO 8601 format)
- ``2006-12-6 13:18``
- ``2006-12-6``
- ``12-6``
- ``12/6``
- ``12/6/6`` (Dec 6 2006)
- ``today`` (midnight)
- ``yesterday`` (midnight)
- ``now`` - right now

Lastly, there is Mercurial's internal format:

- ``1165411109 0`` (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)

This is the internal representation format for dates. The first number
is the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00 UTC). The
second is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC
(negative if the timezone is east of UTC).

The log command also accepts date ranges:

- ``<DATE`` - at or before a given date/time
- ``>DATE`` - on or after a given date/time
- ``DATE to DATE`` - a date range, inclusive
- ``-DAYS`` - within a given number of days of today

.. _diffs:

Diff Formats
""""""""""""

Mercurial's default format for showing changes between two versions of
a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be
used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.

While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the
following information:

- executable status and other permission bits
- copy or rename information
- changes in binary files
- creation or deletion of empty files

Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS
which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not produced
by default because a few widespread tools still do not understand this
format.

This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository
(e.g. with :hg:`export`), you should be careful about things like file
copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because when
applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra
information is lost. Mercurial's internal operations (like push and
pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary
format for communicating changes.

To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the --git
option available for many commands, or set 'git = True' in the [diff]
section of your configuration file. You do not need to set this option
when importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.

.. _environment:
.. _env:

Environment Variables
"""""""""""""""""""""

HG
    Path to the 'hg' executable, automatically passed when running
    hooks, extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is
    the hg executable's name if it's frozen, or an executable named
    'hg' (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on
    Windows) is searched.

HGEDITOR
    This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See EDITOR.

    (deprecated, use configuration file)

HGENCODING
    This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial.
    This setting is used to convert data including usernames,
    changeset descriptions, tag names, and branches. This setting can
    be overridden with the --encoding command-line option.

HGENCODINGMODE
    This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling unknown characters
    while transcoding user input. The default is "strict", which
    causes Mercurial to abort if it can't map a character. Other
    settings include "replace", which replaces unknown characters, and
    "ignore", which drops them. This setting can be overridden with
    the --encodingmode command-line option.

HGENCODINGAMBIGUOUS
    This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling characters with
    "ambiguous" widths like accented Latin characters with East Asian
    fonts. By default, Mercurial assumes ambiguous characters are
    narrow, set this variable to "wide" if such characters cause
    formatting problems.

HGMERGE
    An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
    will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file,
    ancestor file.

    (deprecated, use configuration file)

HGRCPATH
    A list of files or directories to search for configuration
    files. Item separator is ":" on Unix, ";" on Windows. If HGRCPATH
    is not set, platform default search path is used. If empty, only
    the .hg/hgrc from the current repository is read.

    For each element in HGRCPATH:

    - if it's a directory, all files ending with .rc are added
    - otherwise, the file itself will be added

HGPLAIN
    When set, this disables any configuration settings that might
    change Mercurial's default output. This includes encoding,
    defaults, verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks, and
    localization. This can be useful when scripting against Mercurial
    in the face of existing user configuration.

    Equivalent options set via command line flags or environment
    variables are not overridden.

HGPLAINEXCEPT
    This is a comma-separated list of features to preserve when
    HGPLAIN is enabled. Currently the following values are supported:

    ``alias``
        Don't remove aliases.
    ``i18n``
        Preserve internationalization.
    ``revsetalias``
        Don't remove revset aliases.

    Setting HGPLAINEXCEPT to anything (even an empty string) will
    enable plain mode.

HGUSER
    This is the string used as the author of a commit. If not set,
    available values will be considered in this order:

    - HGUSER (deprecated)
    - configuration files from the HGRCPATH
    - EMAIL
    - interactive prompt
    - LOGNAME (with ``@hostname`` appended)

    (deprecated, use configuration file)

EMAIL
    May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

LOGNAME
    May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

VISUAL
    This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See EDITOR.

EDITOR
    Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a
    user to modify, for example when writing commit messages. The
    editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment
    variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in that order. The first
    non-empty one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor
    defaults to 'vi'.

PYTHONPATH
    This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be
    set appropriately if this Mercurial is not installed system-wide.

.. _extensions:

Using Additional Features
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of
extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to
existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or
implement hooks.

To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in the
Python search path, create an entry for it in your configuration file,
like this::

  [extensions]
  foo =

You may also specify the full path to an extension::

  [extensions]
  myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py

See :hg:`help config` for more information on configuration files.

Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:
they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced
usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such
as letting you destroy or modify history); they might not be ready
for prime time; or they may alter some usual behaviors of stock
Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to activate extensions as
needed.

To explicitly disable an extension enabled in a configuration file of
broader scope, prepend its path with !::

  [extensions]
  # disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
  bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
  # ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
  baz = !

disabled extensions:

 :acl: hooks for controlling repository access
 :blackbox: log repository events to a blackbox for debugging

.. _fileset:

Specifying File Sets
""""""""""""""""""""

Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
files.

Like other file patterns, this pattern type is indicated by a prefix,
'set:'. The language supports a number of predicates which are joined
by infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

Identifiers such as filenames or patterns must be quoted with single
or double quotes if they contain characters outside of
``[.*{}[]?/\_a-zA-Z0-9\x80-\xff]`` or if they match one of the
predefined predicates. This generally applies to file patterns other
than globs and arguments for predicates.

Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
e.g., ``\n`` is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being
interpreted, strings can be prefixed with ``r``, e.g. ``r'...'``.

There is a single prefix operator:

``not x``
  Files not in x. Short form is ``! x``.

These are the supported infix operators:

``x and y``
  The intersection of files in x and y. Short form is ``x & y``.

``x or y``
  The union of files in x and y. There are two alternative short
  forms: ``x | y`` and ``x + y``.

``x - y``
  Files in x but not in y.

The following predicates are supported:

``added()``
  File that is added according to :hg:`status`.

``binary()``
  File that appears to be binary (contains NUL bytes).

``clean()``
  File that is clean according to :hg:`status`.

``copied()``
  File that is recorded as being copied.

``deleted()``
  File that is deleted according to :hg:`status`.

``encoding(name)``
  File can be successfully decoded with the given character
  encoding. May not be useful for encodings other than ASCII and
  UTF-8.

``eol(style)``
  File contains newlines of the given style (dos, unix, mac). Binary
  files are excluded, files with mixed line endings match multiple
  styles.

``exec()``
  File that is marked as executable.

``grep(regex)``
  File contains the given regular expression.

``hgignore()``
  File that matches the active .hgignore pattern.

``ignored()``
  File that is ignored according to :hg:`status`. These files will only be
  considered if this predicate is used.

``modified()``
  File that is modified according to :hg:`status`.

``portable()``
  File that has a portable name. (This doesn't include filenames with case
  collisions.)

``removed()``
  File that is removed according to :hg:`status`.

``resolved()``
  File that is marked resolved according to :hg:`resolve -l`.

``size(expression)``
  File size matches the given expression. Examples:
  
  - 1k (files from 1024 to 2047 bytes)
  - < 20k (files less than 20480 bytes)
  - >= .5MB (files at least 524288 bytes)
  - 4k - 1MB (files from 4096 bytes to 1048576 bytes)

``subrepo([pattern])``
  Subrepositories whose paths match the given pattern.

``symlink()``
  File that is marked as a symlink.

``unknown()``
  File that is unknown according to :hg:`status`. These files will only be
  considered if this predicate is used.

``unresolved()``
  File that is marked unresolved according to :hg:`resolve -l`.

Some sample queries:

- Show status of files that appear to be binary in the working directory::

    hg status -A "set:binary()"

- Forget files that are in .hgignore but are already tracked::

    hg forget "set:hgignore() and not ignored()"

- Find text files that contain a string::

    hg files "set:grep(magic) and not binary()"

- Find C files in a non-standard encoding::

    hg files "set:**.c and not encoding('UTF-8')"

- Revert copies of large binary files::

    hg revert "set:copied() and binary() and size('>1M')"

- Remove files listed in foo.lst that contain the letter a or b::

    hg remove "set: 'listfile:foo.lst' and (**a* or **b*)"

See also :hg:`help patterns`.

.. _glossary:

Glossary
""""""""

Ancestor
    Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain of parent
    changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the ancestors
    of a changeset can be defined by two properties: a parent of a
    changeset is an ancestor, and a parent of an ancestor is an
    ancestor. See also: 'Descendant'.

Bookmark
    Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move when
    committing. They are similar to tags in that it is possible to use
    bookmark names in all places where Mercurial expects a changeset
    ID, e.g., with :hg:`update`. Unlike tags, bookmarks move along
    when you make a commit.

    Bookmarks can be renamed, copied and deleted. Bookmarks are local,
    unless they are explicitly pushed or pulled between repositories.
    Pushing and pulling bookmarks allow you to collaborate with others
    on a branch without creating a named branch.

Branch
    (Noun) A child changeset that has been created from a parent that
    is not a head. These are known as topological branches, see
    'Branch, topological'. If a topological branch is named, it becomes
    a named branch. If a topological branch is not named, it becomes
    an anonymous branch. See 'Branch, anonymous' and 'Branch, named'.

    Branches may be created when changes are pulled from or pushed to
    a remote repository, since new heads may be created by these
    operations. Note that the term branch can also be used informally
    to describe a development process in which certain development is
    done independently of other development. This is sometimes done
    explicitly with a named branch, but it can also be done locally,
    using bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.

    Example: "The experimental branch."

    (Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which results in
    its parent having more than one child.

    Example: "I'm going to branch at X."

Branch, anonymous
    Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is not
    a head and the name of the branch is not changed, a new anonymous
    branch is created.

Branch, closed
    A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.

Branch, default
    The branch assigned to a changeset when no name has previously been
    assigned.

Branch head
    See 'Head, branch'.

Branch, inactive
    If a named branch has no topological heads, it is considered to be
    inactive. As an example, a feature branch becomes inactive when it
    is merged into the default branch. The :hg:`branches` command
    shows inactive branches by default, though they can be hidden with
    :hg:`branches --active`.

    NOTE: this concept is deprecated because it is too implicit.
    Branches should now be explicitly closed using :hg:`commit
    --close-branch` when they are no longer needed.

Branch, named
    A collection of changesets which have the same branch name. By
    default, children of a changeset in a named branch belong to the
    same named branch. A child can be explicitly assigned to a
    different branch. See :hg:`help branch`, :hg:`help branches` and
    :hg:`commit --close-branch` for more information on managing
    branches.

    Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace, dividing
    the collection of changesets that comprise the repository into a
    collection of disjoint subsets. A named branch is not necessarily
    a topological branch. If a new named branch is created from the
    head of another named branch, or the default branch, but no
    further changesets are added to that previous branch, then that
    previous branch will be a branch in name only.

Branch tip
    See 'Tip, branch'.

Branch, topological
    Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is
    not a head, a new topological branch is created. If a topological
    branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If a topological
    branch is not named, it becomes an anonymous branch of the
    current, possibly default, branch.

Changelog
    A record of the changesets in the order in which they were added
    to the repository. This includes details such as changeset id,
    author, commit message, date, and list of changed files.

Changeset
    A snapshot of the state of the repository used to record a change.

Changeset, child
    The converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C, then C is
    a child of P. There is no limit to the number of children that a
    changeset may have.

Changeset id
    A SHA-1 hash that uniquely identifies a changeset. It may be
    represented as either a "long" 40 hexadecimal digit string, or a
    "short" 12 hexadecimal digit string.

Changeset, merge
    A changeset with two parents. This occurs when a merge is
    committed.

Changeset, parent
    A revision upon which a child changeset is based. Specifically, a
    parent changeset of a changeset C is a changeset whose node
    immediately precedes C in the DAG. Changesets have at most two
    parents.

Checkout
    (Noun) The working directory being updated to a specific
    revision. This use should probably be avoided where possible, as
    changeset is much more appropriate than checkout in this context.

    Example: "I'm using checkout X."

    (Verb) Updating the working directory to a specific changeset. See
    :hg:`help update`.

    Example: "I'm going to check out changeset X."

Child changeset
    See 'Changeset, child'.

Close changeset
    See 'Head, closed branch'.

Closed branch
    See 'Branch, closed'.

Clone
    (Noun) An entire or partial copy of a repository. The partial
    clone must be in the form of a revision and its ancestors.

    Example: "Is your clone up to date?"

    (Verb) The process of creating a clone, using :hg:`clone`.

    Example: "I'm going to clone the repository."

Closed branch head
    See 'Head, closed branch'.

Commit
    (Noun) A synonym for changeset.

    Example: "Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?"

    (Verb) The act of recording changes to a repository. When files
    are committed in a working directory, Mercurial finds the
    differences between the committed files and their parent
    changeset, creating a new changeset in the repository.

    Example: "You should commit those changes now."

Cset
    A common abbreviation of the term changeset.

DAG
    The repository of changesets of a distributed version control
    system (DVCS) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG),
    consisting of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to
    changesets and edges imply a parent -> child relation. This graph
    can be visualized by graphical tools such as :hg:`log --graph`. In
    Mercurial, the DAG is limited by the requirement for children to
    have at most two parents.

Deprecated
    Feature removed from documentation, but not scheduled for removal.

Default branch
    See 'Branch, default'.

Descendant
    Any changeset that can be reached by a chain of child changesets
    from a given changeset. More precisely, the descendants of a
    changeset can be defined by two properties: the child of a
    changeset is a descendant, and the child of a descendant is a
    descendant. See also: 'Ancestor'.

Diff
    (Noun) The difference between the contents and attributes of files
    in two changesets or a changeset and the current working
    directory. The difference is usually represented in a standard
    form called a "diff" or "patch". The "git diff" format is used
    when the changes include copies, renames, or changes to file
    attributes, none of which can be represented/handled by classic
    "diff" and "patch".

    Example: "Did you see my correction in the diff?"

    (Verb) Diffing two changesets is the action of creating a diff or
    patch.

    Example: "If you diff with changeset X, you will see what I mean."

Directory, working
    The working directory represents the state of the files tracked by
    Mercurial, that will be recorded in the next commit. The working
    directory initially corresponds to the snapshot at an existing
    changeset, known as the parent of the working directory. See
    'Parent, working directory'. The state may be modified by changes
    to the files introduced manually or by a merge. The repository
    metadata exists in the .hg directory inside the working directory.

Draft
    Changesets in the draft phase have not been shared with publishing
    repositories and may thus be safely changed by history-modifying
    extensions. See :hg:`help phases`.

Experimental
    Feature that may change or be removed at a later date.

Graph
    See DAG and :hg:`log --graph`.

Head
    The term 'head' may be used to refer to both a branch head or a
    repository head, depending on the context. See 'Head, branch' and
    'Head, repository' for specific definitions.

    Heads are where development generally takes place and are the
    usual targets for update and merge operations.

Head, branch
    A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.

Head, closed branch
    A changeset that marks a head as no longer interesting. The closed
    head is no longer listed by :hg:`heads`. A branch is considered
    closed when all its heads are closed and consequently is not
    listed by :hg:`branches`.

    Closed heads can be re-opened by committing new changeset as the
    child of the changeset that marks a head as closed.

Head, repository
    A topological head which has not been closed.

Head, topological
    A changeset with no children in the repository.

History, immutable
    Once committed, changesets cannot be altered.  Extensions which
    appear to change history actually create new changesets that
    replace existing ones, and then destroy the old changesets. Doing
    so in public repositories can result in old changesets being
    reintroduced to the repository.

History, rewriting
    The changesets in a repository are immutable. However, extensions
    to Mercurial can be used to alter the repository, usually in such
    a way as to preserve changeset contents.

Immutable history
    See 'History, immutable'.

Merge changeset
    See 'Changeset, merge'.

Manifest
    Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of files that are
    tracked by the changeset.

Merge
    Used to bring together divergent branches of work. When you update
    to a changeset and then merge another changeset, you bring the
    history of the latter changeset into your working directory. Once
    conflicts are resolved (and marked), this merge may be committed
    as a merge changeset, bringing two branches together in the DAG.

Named branch
    See 'Branch, named'.

Null changeset
    The empty changeset. It is the parent state of newly-initialized
    repositories and repositories with no checked out revision. It is
    thus the parent of root changesets and the effective ancestor when
    merging unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias 'null'
    or by the changeset ID '000000000000'.

Parent
    See 'Changeset, parent'.

Parent changeset
    See 'Changeset, parent'.

Parent, working directory
    The working directory parent reflects a virtual revision which is
    the child of the changeset (or two changesets with an uncommitted
    merge) shown by :hg:`parents`. This is changed with
    :hg:`update`. Other commands to see the working directory parent
    are :hg:`summary` and :hg:`id`. Can be specified by the alias ".".

Patch
    (Noun) The product of a diff operation.

    Example: "I've sent you my patch."

    (Verb) The process of using a patch file to transform one
    changeset into another.

    Example: "You will need to patch that revision."

Phase
    A per-changeset state tracking how the changeset has been or
    should be shared. See :hg:`help phases`.

Public
    Changesets in the public phase have been shared with publishing
    repositories and are therefore considered immutable. See :hg:`help
    phases`.

Pull
    An operation in which changesets in a remote repository which are
    not in the local repository are brought into the local
    repository. Note that this operation without special arguments
    only updates the repository, it does not update the files in the
    working directory. See :hg:`help pull`.

Push
    An operation in which changesets in a local repository which are
    not in a remote repository are sent to the remote repository. Note
    that this operation only adds changesets which have been committed
    locally to the remote repository. Uncommitted changes are not
    sent. See :hg:`help push`.

Repository
    The metadata describing all recorded states of a collection of
    files. Each recorded state is represented by a changeset. A
    repository is usually (but not always) found in the ``.hg``
    subdirectory of a working directory. Any recorded state can be
    recreated by "updating" a working directory to a specific
    changeset.

Repository head
    See 'Head, repository'.

Revision
    A state of the repository at some point in time. Earlier revisions
    can be updated to by using :hg:`update`.  See also 'Revision
    number'; See also 'Changeset'.

Revision number
    This integer uniquely identifies a changeset in a specific
    repository. It represents the order in which changesets were added
    to a repository, starting with revision number 0. Note that the
    revision number may be different in each clone of a repository. To
    identify changesets uniquely between different clones, see
    'Changeset id'.

Revlog
    History storage mechanism used by Mercurial. It is a form of delta
    encoding, with occasional full revision of data followed by delta
    of each successive revision. It includes data and an index
    pointing to the data.

Rewriting history
    See 'History, rewriting'.

Root
    A changeset that has only the null changeset as its parent. Most
    repositories have only a single root changeset.

Secret
    Changesets in the secret phase may not be shared via push, pull,
    or clone. See :hg:`help phases`.

Tag
    An alternative name given to a changeset. Tags can be used in all
    places where Mercurial expects a changeset ID, e.g., with
    :hg:`update`. The creation of a tag is stored in the history and
    will thus automatically be shared with other using push and pull.

Tip
    The changeset with the highest revision number. It is the changeset
    most recently added in a repository.

Tip, branch
    The head of a given branch with the highest revision number. When
    a branch name is used as a revision identifier, it refers to the
    branch tip. See also 'Branch, head'. Note that because revision
    numbers may be different in different repository clones, the
    branch tip may be different in different cloned repositories.

Update
    (Noun) Another synonym of changeset.

    Example: "I've pushed an update."

    (Verb) This term is usually used to describe updating the state of
    the working directory to that of a specific changeset. See
    :hg:`help update`.

    Example: "You should update."

Working directory
    See 'Directory, working'.

Working directory parent
    See 'Parent, working directory'.

Syntax for Mercurial Ignore Files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Synopsis
========

The Mercurial system uses a file called ``.hgignore`` in the root
directory of a repository to control its behavior when it searches
for files that it is not currently tracking.

Description
===========

The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain
files that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These include backup
files created by editors and build products created by compilers.
These files can be ignored by listing them in a ``.hgignore`` file in
the root of the working directory. The ``.hgignore`` file must be
created manually. It is typically put under version control, so that
the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull.

An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository
root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against
any pattern in ``.hgignore``.

For example, say we have an untracked file, ``file.c``, at
``a/b/file.c`` inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore ``file.c``
if any pattern in ``.hgignore`` matches ``a/b/file.c``, ``a/b`` or ``a``.

In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set of
per-user or global ignore files. See the ``ignore`` configuration
key on the ``[ui]`` section of :hg:`help config` for details of how to
configure these files.

To control Mercurial's handling of files that it manages, many
commands support the ``-I`` and ``-X`` options; see
:hg:`help <command>` and :hg:`help patterns` for details.

Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore, even
if they appear in .hgignore. An untracked file X can be explicitly
added with :hg:`add X`, even if X would be excluded by a pattern
in .hgignore.

Syntax
======

An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns,
with one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The ``#``
character is treated as a comment character, and the ``\`` character
is treated as an escape character.

Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax used
is Python/Perl-style regular expressions.

To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form::

  syntax: NAME

where ``NAME`` is one of the following:

``regexp``
  Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.
``glob``
  Shell-style glob.

The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that
follow, until another syntax is selected.

Neither glob nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax pattern of
the form ``*.c`` will match a file ending in ``.c`` in any directory,
and a regexp pattern of the form ``\.c$`` will do the same. To root a
regexp pattern, start it with ``^``.

Subdirectories can have their own .hgignore settings by adding
``subinclude:path/to/subdir/.hgignore`` to the root ``.hgignore``. See
:hg:`help patterns` for details on ``subinclude:`` and ``include:``.

.. note::

  Patterns specified in other than ``.hgignore`` are always rooted.
  Please see :hg:`help patterns` for details.

Example
=======

Here is an example ignore file. ::

  # use glob syntax.
  syntax: glob

  *.elc
  *.pyc
  *~

  # switch to regexp syntax.
  syntax: regexp
  ^\.pc/

.. _hgweb:

Configuring hgweb
"""""""""""""""""

Mercurial's internal web server, hgweb, can serve either a single
repository, or a tree of repositories. In the second case, repository
paths and global options can be defined using a dedicated
configuration file common to :hg:`serve`, ``hgweb.wsgi``,
``hgweb.cgi`` and ``hgweb.fcgi``.

This file uses the same syntax as other Mercurial configuration files
but recognizes only the following sections:

  - web
  - paths
  - collections

The ``web`` options are thoroughly described in :hg:`help config`.

The ``paths`` section maps URL paths to paths of repositories in the
filesystem. hgweb will not expose the filesystem directly - only
Mercurial repositories can be published and only according to the
configuration.

The left hand side is the path in the URL. Note that hgweb reserves
subpaths like ``rev`` or ``file``, try using different names for
nested repositories to avoid confusing effects.

The right hand side is the path in the filesystem. If the specified
path ends with ``*`` or ``**`` the filesystem will be searched
recursively for repositories below that point.
With ``*`` it will not recurse into the repositories it finds (except for
``.hg/patches``).
With ``**`` it will also search inside repository working directories
and possibly find subrepositories.

In this example::

  [paths]
  /projects/a = /srv/tmprepos/a
  /projects/b = c:/repos/b
  / = /srv/repos/*
  /user/bob = /home/bob/repos/**

- The first two entries make two repositories in different directories
  appear under the same directory in the web interface
- The third entry will publish every Mercurial repository found in
  ``/srv/repos/``, for instance the repository ``/srv/repos/quux/``
  will appear as ``http://server/quux/``
- The fourth entry will publish both ``http://server/user/bob/quux/``
  and ``http://server/user/bob/quux/testsubrepo/``

The ``collections`` section is deprecated and has been superseded by
``paths``.

URLs and Common Arguments
=========================

URLs under each repository have the form ``/{command}[/{arguments}]``
where ``{command}`` represents the name of a command or handler and
``{arguments}`` represents any number of additional URL parameters
to that command.

The web server has a default style associated with it. Styles map to
a collection of named templates. Each template is used to render a
specific piece of data, such as a changeset or diff.

The style for the current request can be overwritten two ways. First,
if ``{command}`` contains a hyphen (``-``), the text before the hyphen
defines the style. For example, ``/atom-log`` will render the ``log``
command handler with the ``atom`` style. The second way to set the
style is with the ``style`` query string argument. For example,
``/log?style=atom``. The hyphenated URL parameter is preferred.

Not all templates are available for all styles. Attempting to use
a style that doesn't have all templates defined may result in an error
rendering the page.

Many commands take a ``{revision}`` URL parameter. This defines the
changeset to operate on. This is commonly specified as the short,
12 digit hexadecimal abbreviation for the full 40 character unique
revision identifier. However, any value described by
:hg:`help revisions` typically works.

Commands and URLs
=================

The following web commands and their URLs are available:

  
/annotate/{revision}/{path}
---------------------------

Show changeset information for each line in a file.

The ``fileannotate`` template is rendered.


/archive/{revision}.{format}[/{path}]
-------------------------------------

Obtain an archive of repository content.

The content and type of the archive is defined by a URL path parameter.
``format`` is the file extension of the archive type to be generated. e.g.
``zip`` or ``tar.bz2``. Not all archive types may be allowed by your
server configuration.

The optional ``path`` URL parameter controls content to include in the
archive. If omitted, every file in the specified revision is present in the
archive. If included, only the specified file or contents of the specified
directory will be included in the archive.

No template is used for this handler. Raw, binary content is generated.


/bookmarks
----------

Show information about bookmarks.

No arguments are accepted.

The ``bookmarks`` template is rendered.


/branches
---------

Show information about branches.

All known branches are contained in the output, even closed branches.

No arguments are accepted.

The ``branches`` template is rendered.


/changelog[/{revision}]
-----------------------

Show information about multiple changesets.

If the optional ``revision`` URL argument is absent, information about
all changesets starting at ``tip`` will be rendered. If the ``revision``
argument is present, changesets will be shown starting from the specified
revision.

If ``revision`` is absent, the ``rev`` query string argument may be
defined. This will perform a search for changesets.

The argument for ``rev`` can be a single revision, a revision set,
or a literal keyword to search for in changeset data (equivalent to
:hg:`log -k`).

The ``revcount`` query string argument defines the maximum numbers of
changesets to render.

For non-searches, the ``changelog`` template will be rendered.


/changeset[/{revision}]
-----------------------

Show information about a single changeset.

A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See ``hg help
revisions`` for possible values. If not defined, the ``tip`` changeset
will be shown.

The ``changeset`` template is rendered. Contents of the ``changesettag``,
``changesetbookmark``, ``filenodelink``, ``filenolink``, and the many
templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.


/comparison/{revision}/{path}
-----------------------------

Show a comparison between the old and new versions of a file from changes
made on a particular revision.

This is similar to the ``diff`` handler. However, this form features
a split or side-by-side diff rather than a unified diff.

The ``context`` query string argument can be used to control the lines of
context in the diff.

The ``filecomparison`` template is rendered.


/diff/{revision}/{path}
-----------------------

Show how a file changed in a particular commit.

The ``filediff`` template is rendered.

This handler is registered under both the ``/diff`` and ``/filediff``
paths. ``/diff`` is used in modern code.


/file/{revision}[/{path}]
-------------------------

Show information about a directory or file in the repository.

Info about the ``path`` given as a URL parameter will be rendered.

If ``path`` is a directory, information about the entries in that
directory will be rendered. This form is equivalent to the ``manifest``
handler.

If ``path`` is a file, information about that file will be shown via
the ``filerevision`` template.

If ``path`` is not defined, information about the root directory will
be rendered.


/diff/{revision}/{path}
-----------------------

Show how a file changed in a particular commit.

The ``filediff`` template is rendered.

This handler is registered under both the ``/diff`` and ``/filediff``
paths. ``/diff`` is used in modern code.


/filelog/{revision}/{path}
--------------------------

Show information about the history of a file in the repository.

The ``revcount`` query string argument can be defined to control the
maximum number of entries to show.

The ``filelog`` template will be rendered.


/graph[/{revision}]
-------------------

Show information about the graphical topology of the repository.

Information rendered by this handler can be used to create visual
representations of repository topology.

The ``revision`` URL parameter controls the starting changeset.

The ``revcount`` query string argument can define the number of changesets
to show information for.

This handler will render the ``graph`` template.


/help[/{topic}]
---------------

Render help documentation.

This web command is roughly equivalent to :hg:`help`. If a ``topic``
is defined, that help topic will be rendered. If not, an index of
available help topics will be rendered.

The ``help`` template will be rendered when requesting help for a topic.
``helptopics`` will be rendered for the index of help topics.


/log[/{revision}[/{path}]]
--------------------------

Show repository or file history.

For URLs of the form ``/log/{revision}``, a list of changesets starting at
the specified changeset identifier is shown. If ``{revision}`` is not
defined, the default is ``tip``. This form is equivalent to the
``changelog`` handler.

For URLs of the form ``/log/{revision}/{file}``, the history for a specific
file will be shown. This form is equivalent to the ``filelog`` handler.


/manifest[/{revision}[/{path}]]
-------------------------------

Show information about a directory.

If the URL path arguments are omitted, information about the root
directory for the ``tip`` changeset will be shown.

Because this handler can only show information for directories, it
is recommended to use the ``file`` handler instead, as it can handle both
directories and files.

The ``manifest`` template will be rendered for this handler.


/changeset[/{revision}]
-----------------------

Show information about a single changeset.

A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See ``hg help
revisions`` for possible values. If not defined, the ``tip`` changeset
will be shown.

The ``changeset`` template is rendered. Contents of the ``changesettag``,
``changesetbookmark``, ``filenodelink``, ``filenolink``, and the many
templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.


/shortlog
---------

Show basic information about a set of changesets.

This accepts the same parameters as the ``changelog`` handler. The only
difference is the ``shortlog`` template will be rendered instead of the
``changelog`` template.


/summary
--------

Show a summary of repository state.

Information about the latest changesets, bookmarks, tags, and branches
is captured by this handler.

The ``summary`` template is rendered.


/tags
-----

Show information about tags.

No arguments are accepted.

The ``tags`` template is rendered.

Merge Tools
"""""""""""

To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.

A merge tool combines two different versions of a file into a merged
file. Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest common
ancestor of the two file versions, so they can determine the changes
made on both branches.

Merge tools are used both for :hg:`resolve`, :hg:`merge`, :hg:`update`,
:hg:`backout` and in several extensions.

Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically reconcile the files by
combining all non-overlapping changes that occurred separately in
the two different evolutions of the same initial base file. Furthermore, some
interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve
conflicting merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting some
conflict markers. Mercurial does not include any interactive merge
programs but relies on external tools for that.

Available merge tools
=====================

External merge tools and their properties are configured in the
merge-tools configuration section - see hgrc(5) - but they can often just
be named by their executable.

A merge tool is generally usable if its executable can be found on the
system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is found if it
is an absolute or relative executable path or the name of an
application in the executable search path. The tool is assumed to be
able to handle the merge if it can handle symlinks if the file is a
symlink, if it can handle binary files if the file is binary, and if a
GUI is available if the tool requires a GUI.

There are some internal merge tools which can be used. The internal
merge tools are:

``:dump``
  Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing the
  contents of local, other and base. These files can then be used to
  perform a merge manually. If the file to be merged is named
  ``a.txt``, these files will accordingly be named ``a.txt.local``,
  ``a.txt.other`` and ``a.txt.base`` and they will be placed in the
  same directory as ``a.txt``.

``:fail``
  Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified on both
  branches, it marks them as unresolved. The resolve command must be
  used to resolve these conflicts.

``:local``
  Uses the local version of files as the merged version.

``:merge``
  Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
  files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in
  the partially merged file. Markers will have two sections, one for each side
  of merge.

``:merge-local``
  Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively in favor
  of the local changes.

``:merge-other``
  Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively in favor
  of the other changes.

``:merge3``
  Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
  files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in
  the partially merged file. Marker will have three sections, one from each
  side of the merge and one for the base content.

``:other``
  Uses the other version of files as the merged version.

``:prompt``
  Asks the user which of the local or the other version to keep as
  the merged version.

``:tagmerge``
  Uses the internal tag merge algorithm (experimental).

``:union``
  Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
  files. It will use both left and right sides for conflict regions.
  No markers are inserted.

Internal tools are always available and do not require a GUI but will by default
not handle symlinks or binary files.

Choosing a merge tool
=====================

Mercurial uses these rules when deciding which merge tool to use:

1. If a tool has been specified with the --tool option to merge or resolve, it
   is used.  If it is the name of a tool in the merge-tools configuration, its
   configuration is used. Otherwise the specified tool must be executable by
   the shell.

2. If the ``HGMERGE`` environment variable is present, its value is used and
   must be executable by the shell.

3. If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of the patterns in the
   merge-patterns configuration section, the first usable merge tool
   corresponding to a matching pattern is used. Here, binary capabilities of the
   merge tool are not considered.

4. If ui.merge is set it will be considered next. If the value is not the name
   of a configured tool, the specified value is used and must be executable by
   the shell. Otherwise the named tool is used if it is usable.

5. If any usable merge tools are present in the merge-tools configuration
   section, the one with the highest priority is used.

6. If a program named ``hgmerge`` can be found on the system, it is used - but
   it will by default not be used for symlinks and binary files.

7. If the file to be merged is not binary and is not a symlink, then
   internal ``:merge`` is used.

8. The merge of the file fails and must be resolved before commit.

.. note::

   After selecting a merge program, Mercurial will by default attempt
   to merge the files using a simple merge algorithm first. Only if it doesn't
   succeed because of conflicting changes Mercurial will actually execute the
   merge program. Whether to use the simple merge algorithm first can be
   controlled by the premerge setting of the merge tool. Premerge is enabled by
   default unless the file is binary or a symlink.

See the merge-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on the
configuration of merge tools.

Specifying Multiple Revisions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be specified
individually, or provided as a topologically continuous range,
separated by the ":" character.

The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END are
revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If BEGIN is not
specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END is not specified,
it defaults to the tip. The range ":" thus means "all revisions".

If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse order.

A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5
gives 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6 gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.

.. _patterns:

File Name Patterns
""""""""""""""""""

Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files
at a time.

By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style extended glob
patterns.

Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.

.. note::

  Patterns specified in ``.hgignore`` are not rooted.
  Please see :hg:`help hgignore` for details.

To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it with
``path:``. These path names must completely match starting at the
current repository root.

To use an extended glob, start a name with ``glob:``. Globs are rooted
at the current directory; a glob such as ``*.c`` will only match files
in the current directory ending with ``.c``.

The supported glob syntax extensions are ``**`` to match any string
across path separators and ``{a,b}`` to mean "a or b".

To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with ``re:``.
Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.

To read name patterns from a file, use ``listfile:`` or ``listfile0:``.
The latter expects null delimited patterns while the former expects line
feeds. Each string read from the file is itself treated as a file
pattern.

To read a set of patterns from a file, use ``include:`` or ``subinclude:``.
``include:`` will use all the patterns from the given file and treat them as if
they had been passed in manually.  ``subinclude:`` will only apply the patterns
against files that are under the subinclude file's directory. See :hg:`help
hgignore` for details on the format of these files.

All patterns, except for ``glob:`` specified in command line (not for
``-I`` or ``-X`` options), can match also against directories: files
under matched directories are treated as matched.

Plain examples::

  path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
                 of the repository
  path:path:name a file or directory named "path:name"

Glob examples::

  glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
  *.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
  **.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
                 current directory including itself.
  foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
  foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
                 including itself.

Regexp examples::

  re:.*\.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository

File examples::

  listfile:list.txt  read list from list.txt with one file pattern per line
  listfile0:list.txt read list from list.txt with null byte delimiters

See also :hg:`help filesets`.

Include examples::

  include:path/to/mypatternfile    reads patterns to be applied to all paths
  subinclude:path/to/subignorefile reads patterns specifically for paths in the
                                   subdirectory

.. _phases:

Working with Phases
"""""""""""""""""""

What are phases?
================

Phases are a system for tracking which changesets have been or should
be shared. This helps prevent common mistakes when modifying history
(for instance, with the mq or rebase extensions).

Each changeset in a repository is in one of the following phases:

 - public : changeset is visible on a public server
 - draft : changeset is not yet published
 - secret : changeset should not be pushed, pulled, or cloned

These phases are ordered (public < draft < secret) and no changeset
can be in a lower phase than its ancestors. For instance, if a
changeset is public, all its ancestors are also public. Lastly,
changeset phases should only be changed towards the public phase.

How are phases managed?
=======================

For the most part, phases should work transparently. By default, a
changeset is created in the draft phase and is moved into the public
phase when it is pushed to another repository.

Once changesets become public, extensions like mq and rebase will
refuse to operate on them to prevent creating duplicate changesets.
Phases can also be manually manipulated with the :hg:`phase` command
if needed. See :hg:`help -v phase` for examples.

Phases and servers
==================

Normally, all servers are ``publishing`` by default. This means::

 - all draft changesets that are pulled or cloned appear in phase
 public on the client

 - all draft changesets that are pushed appear as public on both
 client and server

 - secret changesets are neither pushed, pulled, or cloned

.. note::

  Pulling a draft changeset from a publishing server does not mark it
  as public on the server side due to the read-only nature of pull.

Sometimes it may be desirable to push and pull changesets in the draft
phase to share unfinished work. This can be done by setting a
repository to disable publishing in its configuration file::

  [phases]
  publish = False

See :hg:`help config` for more information on configuration files.

.. note::

  Servers running older versions of Mercurial are treated as
  publishing.

.. note::

   Changesets in secret phase are not exchanged with the server. This
   applies to their content: file names, file contents, and changeset
   metadata. For technical reasons, the identifier (e.g. d825e4025e39)
   of the secret changeset may be communicated to the server.


Examples
========

 - list changesets in draft or secret phase::

     hg log -r "not public()"

 - change all secret changesets to draft::

     hg phase --draft "secret()"

 - forcibly move the current changeset and descendants from public to draft::

     hg phase --force --draft .

 - show a list of changeset revision and phase::

     hg log --template "{rev} {phase}\n"

 - resynchronize draft changesets relative to a remote repository::

     hg phase -fd "outgoing(URL)"

See :hg:`help phase` for more information on manually manipulating phases.

.. _revisions:
.. _revs:

Specifying Single Revisions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.

A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are
treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the tip,
-2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.

A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
identifier.

A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short-form
identifier. A short-form identifier is only valid if it is the prefix
of exactly one full-length identifier.

Any other string is treated as a bookmark, tag, or branch name. A
bookmark is a movable pointer to a revision. A tag is a permanent name
associated with a revision. A branch name denotes the tipmost open branch head
of that branch - or if they are all closed, the tipmost closed head of the
branch. Bookmark, tag, and branch names must not contain the ":" character.

The reserved name "tip" always identifies the most recent revision.

The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the
revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.

The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If no
working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an
uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the first
parent.

.. _revsets:
.. _revset:

Specifying Revision Sets
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
revisions.

The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by infix
operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

Identifiers such as branch names may need quoting with single or
double quotes if they contain characters like ``-`` or if they match
one of the predefined predicates.

Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
e.g., ``\n`` is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being
interpreted, strings can be prefixed with ``r``, e.g. ``r'...'``.

There is a single prefix operator:

``not x``
  Changesets not in x. Short form is ``! x``.

These are the supported infix operators:

``x::y``
  A DAG range, meaning all changesets that are descendants of x and
  ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If the first endpoint
  is left out, this is equivalent to ``ancestors(y)``, if the second
  is left out it is equivalent to ``descendants(x)``.

  An alternative syntax is ``x..y``.

``x:y``
  All changesets with revision numbers between x and y, both
  inclusive. Either endpoint can be left out, they default to 0 and
  tip.

``x and y``
  The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is ``x & y``.

``x or y``
  The union of changesets in x and y. There are two alternative short
  forms: ``x | y`` and ``x + y``.

``x - y``
  Changesets in x but not in y.

``x^n``
  The nth parent of x, n == 0, 1, or 2.
  For n == 0, x; for n == 1, the first parent of each changeset in x;
  for n == 2, the second parent of changeset in x.

``x~n``
  The nth first ancestor of x; ``x~0`` is x; ``x~3`` is ``x^^^``.

There is a single postfix operator:

``x^``
  Equivalent to ``x^1``, the first parent of each changeset in x.


The following predicates are supported:

``adds(pattern)``
  Changesets that add a file matching pattern.
  
  The pattern without explicit kind like ``glob:`` is expected to be
  relative to the current directory and match against a file or a
  directory.

``all()``
  All changesets, the same as ``0:tip``.

``ancestor(*changeset)``
  A greatest common ancestor of the changesets.
  
  Accepts 0 or more changesets.
  Will return empty list when passed no args.
  Greatest common ancestor of a single changeset is that changeset.

``ancestors(set)``
  Changesets that are ancestors of a changeset in set.

``author(string)``
  Alias for ``user(string)``.

``bisect(string)``
  Changesets marked in the specified bisect status:
  
  - ``good``, ``bad``, ``skip``: csets explicitly marked as good/bad/skip
  - ``goods``, ``bads``      : csets topologically good/bad
  - ``range``              : csets taking part in the bisection
  - ``pruned``             : csets that are goods, bads or skipped
  - ``untested``           : csets whose fate is yet unknown
  - ``ignored``            : csets ignored due to DAG topology
  - ``current``            : the cset currently being bisected

``bookmark([name])``
  The named bookmark or all bookmarks.
  
  If `name` starts with `re:`, the remainder of the name is treated as
  a regular expression. To match a bookmark that actually starts with `re:`,
  use the prefix `literal:`.

``branch(string or set)``
  All changesets belonging to the given branch or the branches of the given
  changesets.
  
  If `string` starts with `re:`, the remainder of the name is treated as
  a regular expression. To match a branch that actually starts with `re:`,
  use the prefix `literal:`.

``branchpoint()``
  Changesets with more than one child.

``bumped()``
  Mutable changesets marked as successors of public changesets.
  
  Only non-public and non-obsolete changesets can be `bumped`.

``bundle()``
  Changesets in the bundle.
  
  Bundle must be specified by the -R option.

``children(set)``
  Child changesets of changesets in set.

``closed()``
  Changeset is closed.

``contains(pattern)``
  The revision's manifest contains a file matching pattern (but might not
  modify it). See :hg:`help patterns` for information about file patterns.
  
  The pattern without explicit kind like ``glob:`` is expected to be
  relative to the current directory and match against a file exactly
  for efficiency.

``converted([id])``
  Changesets converted from the given identifier in the old repository if
  present, or all converted changesets if no identifier is specified.

``date(interval)``
  Changesets within the interval, see :hg:`help dates`.

``desc(string)``
  Search commit message for string. The match is case-insensitive.

``descendants(set)``
  Changesets which are descendants of changesets in set.

``destination([set])``
  Changesets that were created by a graft, transplant or rebase operation,
  with the given revisions specified as the source.  Omitting the optional set
  is the same as passing all().

``divergent()``
  Final successors of changesets with an alternative set of final successors.

``draft()``
  Changeset in draft phase.

``extinct()``
  Obsolete changesets with obsolete descendants only.

``extra(label, [value])``
  Changesets with the given label in the extra metadata, with the given
  optional value.
  
  If `value` starts with `re:`, the remainder of the value is treated as
  a regular expression. To match a value that actually starts with `re:`,
  use the prefix `literal:`.

``file(pattern)``
  Changesets affecting files matched by pattern.
  
  For a faster but less accurate result, consider using ``filelog()``
  instead.
  
  This predicate uses ``glob:`` as the default kind of pattern.

``filelog(pattern)``
  Changesets connected to the specified filelog.
  
  For performance reasons, visits only revisions mentioned in the file-level
  filelog, rather than filtering through all changesets (much faster, but
  doesn't include deletes or duplicate changes). For a slower, more accurate
  result, use ``file()``.
  
  The pattern without explicit kind like ``glob:`` is expected to be
  relative to the current directory and match against a file exactly
  for efficiency.
  
  If some linkrev points to revisions filtered by the current repoview, we'll
  work around it to return a non-filtered value.

``first(set, [n])``
  An alias for limit().

``follow([pattern])``
  An alias for ``::.`` (ancestors of the working directory's first parent).
  If pattern is specified, the histories of files matching given
  pattern is followed, including copies.

``grep(regex)``
  Like ``keyword(string)`` but accepts a regex. Use ``grep(r'...')``
  to ensure special escape characters are handled correctly. Unlike
  ``keyword(string)``, the match is case-sensitive.

``head()``
  Changeset is a named branch head.

``heads(set)``
  Members of set with no children in set.

``hidden()``
  Hidden changesets.

``id(string)``
  Revision non-ambiguously specified by the given hex string prefix.

``keyword(string)``
  Search commit message, user name, and names of changed files for
  string. The match is case-insensitive.

``last(set, [n])``
  Last n members of set, defaulting to 1.

``limit(set[, n[, offset]])``
  First n members of set, defaulting to 1, starting from offset.

``matching(revision [, field])``
  Changesets in which a given set of fields match the set of fields in the
  selected revision or set.
  
  To match more than one field pass the list of fields to match separated
  by spaces (e.g. ``author description``).
  
  Valid fields are most regular revision fields and some special fields.
  
  Regular revision fields are ``description``, ``author``, ``branch``,
  ``date``, ``files``, ``phase``, ``parents``, ``substate``, ``user``
  and ``diff``.
  Note that ``author`` and ``user`` are synonyms. ``diff`` refers to the
  contents of the revision. Two revisions matching their ``diff`` will
  also match their ``files``.
  
  Special fields are ``summary`` and ``metadata``:
  ``summary`` matches the first line of the description.
  ``metadata`` is equivalent to matching ``description user date``
  (i.e. it matches the main metadata fields).
  
  ``metadata`` is the default field which is used when no fields are
  specified. You can match more than one field at a time.

``max(set)``
  Changeset with highest revision number in set.

``merge()``
  Changeset is a merge changeset.

``min(set)``
  Changeset with lowest revision number in set.

``modifies(pattern)``
  Changesets modifying files matched by pattern.
  
  The pattern without explicit kind like ``glob:`` is expected to be
  relative to the current directory and match against a file or a
  directory.

``named(namespace)``
  The changesets in a given namespace.
  
  If `namespace` starts with `re:`, the remainder of the string is treated as
  a regular expression. To match a namespace that actually starts with `re:`,
  use the prefix `literal:`.

``obsolete()``
  Mutable changeset with a newer version.

``only(set, [set])``
  Changesets that are ancestors of the first set that are not ancestors
  of any other head in the repo. If a second set is specified, the result
  is ancestors of the first set that are not ancestors of the second set
  (i.e. ::<set1> - ::<set2>).

``origin([set])``
  Changesets that were specified as a source for the grafts, transplants or
  rebases that created the given revisions.  Omitting the optional set is the
  same as passing all().  If a changeset created by these operations is itself
  specified as a source for one of these operations, only the source changeset
  for the first operation is selected.

``outgoing([path])``
  Changesets not found in the specified destination repository, or the
  default push location.

``p1([set])``
  First parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.

``p2([set])``
  Second parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.

``parents([set])``
  The set of all parents for all changesets in set, or the working directory.

``present(set)``
  An empty set, if any revision in set isn't found; otherwise,
  all revisions in set.
  
  If any of specified revisions is not present in the local repository,
  the query is normally aborted. But this predicate allows the query
  to continue even in such cases.

``public()``
  Changeset in public phase.

``remote([id [,path]])``
  Local revision that corresponds to the given identifier in a
  remote repository, if present. Here, the '.' identifier is a
  synonym for the current local branch.

``removes(pattern)``
  Changesets which remove files matching pattern.
  
  The pattern without explicit kind like ``glob:`` is expected to be
  relative to the current directory and match against a file or a
  directory.

``rev(number)``
  Revision with the given numeric identifier.

``reverse(set)``
  Reverse order of set.

``roots(set)``
  Changesets in set with no parent changeset in set.

``secret()``
  Changeset in secret phase.

``sort(set[, [-]key...])``
  Sort set by keys. The default sort order is ascending, specify a key
  as ``-key`` to sort in descending order.
  
  The keys can be:
  
  - ``rev`` for the revision number,
  - ``branch`` for the branch name,
  - ``desc`` for the commit message (description),
  - ``user`` for user name (``author`` can be used as an alias),
  - ``date`` for the commit date

``subrepo([pattern])``
  Changesets that add, modify or remove the given subrepo.  If no subrepo
  pattern is named, any subrepo changes are returned.

``tag([name])``
  The specified tag by name, or all tagged revisions if no name is given.
  
  If `name` starts with `re:`, the remainder of the name is treated as
  a regular expression. To match a tag that actually starts with `re:`,
  use the prefix `literal:`.

``unstable()``
  Non-obsolete changesets with obsolete ancestors.

``user(string)``
  User name contains string. The match is case-insensitive.
  
  If `string` starts with `re:`, the remainder of the string is treated as
  a regular expression. To match a user that actually contains `re:`, use
  the prefix `literal:`.

New predicates (known as "aliases") can be defined, using any combination of
existing predicates or other aliases. An alias definition looks like::

  <alias> = <definition>

in the ``revsetalias`` section of a Mercurial configuration file. Arguments
of the form `$1`, `$2`, etc. are substituted from the alias into the
definition.

For example,

::

  [revsetalias]
  h = heads()
  d($1) = sort($1, date)
  rs($1, $2) = reverse(sort($1, $2))

defines three aliases, ``h``, ``d``, and ``rs``. ``rs(0:tip, author)`` is
exactly equivalent to ``reverse(sort(0:tip, author))``.

An infix operator ``##`` can concatenate strings and identifiers into
one string. For example::

  [revsetalias]
  issue($1) = grep(r'\bissue[ :]?' ## $1 ## r'\b|\bbug\(' ## $1 ## r'\)')

``issue(1234)`` is equivalent to ``grep(r'\bissue[ :]?1234\b|\bbug\(1234\)')``
in this case. This matches against all of "issue 1234", "issue:1234",
"issue1234" and "bug(1234)".

All other prefix, infix and postfix operators have lower priority than
``##``. For example, ``$1 ## $2~2`` is equivalent to ``($1 ## $2)~2``.

Command line equivalents for :hg:`log`::

  -f    ->  ::.
  -d x  ->  date(x)
  -k x  ->  keyword(x)
  -m    ->  merge()
  -u x  ->  user(x)
  -b x  ->  branch(x)
  -P x  ->  !::x
  -l x  ->  limit(expr, x)

Some sample queries:

- Changesets on the default branch::

    hg log -r "branch(default)"

- Changesets on the default branch since tag 1.5 (excluding merges)::

    hg log -r "branch(default) and 1.5:: and not merge()"

- Open branch heads::

    hg log -r "head() and not closed()"

- Changesets between tags 1.3 and 1.5 mentioning "bug" that affect
  ``hgext/*``::

    hg log -r "1.3::1.5 and keyword(bug) and file('hgext/*')"

- Changesets committed in May 2008, sorted by user::

    hg log -r "sort(date('May 2008'), user)"

- Changesets mentioning "bug" or "issue" that are not in a tagged
  release::

    hg log -r "(keyword(bug) or keyword(issue)) and not ancestors(tag())"

Using Mercurial from scripts and automation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It is common for machines (as opposed to humans) to consume Mercurial.
This help topic describes some of the considerations for interfacing
machines with Mercurial.

Choosing an Interface
=====================

Machines have a choice of several methods to interface with Mercurial.
These include:

- Executing the ``hg`` process
- Querying a HTTP server
- Calling out to a command server

Executing ``hg`` processes is very similar to how humans interact with
Mercurial in the shell. It should already be familiar to you.

:hg:`serve` can be used to start a server. By default, this will start
a "hgweb" HTTP server. This HTTP server has support for machine-readable
output, such as JSON. For more, see :hg:`help hgweb`.

:hg:`serve` can also start a "command server." Clients can connect
to this server and issue Mercurial commands over a special protocol.
For more details on the command server, including links to client
libraries, see https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer.

:hg:`serve` based interfaces (the hgweb and command servers) have the
advantage over simple ``hg`` process invocations in that they are
likely more efficient. This is because there is significant overhead
to spawn new Python processes.

.. tip::

   If you need to invoke several ``hg`` processes in short order and/or
   performance is important to you, use of a server-based interface
   is highly recommended.

Environment Variables
=====================

As documented in :hg:`help environment`, various environment variables
influence the operation of Mercurial. The following are particularly
relevant for machines consuming Mercurial:

HGPLAIN
    If not set, Mercurial's output could be influenced by configuration
    settings that impact its encoding, verbose mode, localization, etc.

    It is highly recommended for machines to set this variable when
    invoking ``hg`` processes.

HGENCODING
    If not set, the locale used by Mercurial will be detected from the
    environment. If the determined locale does not support display of
    certain characters, Mercurial may render these character sequences
    incorrectly (often by using "?" as a placeholder for invalid
    characters in the current locale).

    Explicitly setting this environment variable is a good practice to
    guarantee consistent results. "utf-8" is a good choice on UNIX-like
    environments.

HGRCPATH
    If not set, Mercurial will inherit config options from config files
    using the process described in :hg:`help config`. This includes
    inheriting user or system-wide config files.

    When utmost control over the Mercurial configuration is desired, the
    value of ``HGRCPATH`` can be set to an explicit file with known good
    configs. In rare cases, the value can be set to an empty file or the
    null device (often ``/dev/null``) to bypass loading of any user or
    system config files. Note that these approaches can have unintended
    consequences, as the user and system config files often define things
    like the username and extensions that may be required to interface
    with a repository.

Consuming Command Output
========================

It is common for machines to need to parse the output of Mercurial
commands for relevant data. This section describes the various
techniques for doing so.

Parsing Raw Command Output
--------------------------

Likely the simplest and most effective solution for consuming command
output is to simply invoke ``hg`` commands as you would as a user and
parse their output.

The output of many commands can easily be parsed with tools like
``grep``, ``sed``, and ``awk``.

A potential downside with parsing command output is that the output
of commands can change when Mercurial is upgraded. While Mercurial
does generally strive for strong backwards compatibility, command
output does occasionally change. Having tests for your automated
interactions with ``hg`` commands is generally recommended, but is
even more important when raw command output parsing is involved.

Using Templates to Control Output
---------------------------------

Many ``hg`` commands support templatized output via the
``-T/--template`` argument. For more, see :hg:`help templates`.

Templates are useful for explicitly controlling output so that
you get exactly the data you want formatted how you want it. For
example, ``log -T {node}\n`` can be used to print a newline
delimited list of changeset nodes instead of a human-tailored
output containing authors, dates, descriptions, etc.

.. tip::

   If parsing raw command output is too complicated, consider
   using templates to make your life easier.

The ``-T/--template`` argument allows specifying pre-defined styles.
Mercurial ships with the machine-readable styles ``json`` and ``xml``,
which provide JSON and XML output, respectively. These are useful for
producing output that is machine readable as-is.

.. important::

   The ``json`` and ``xml`` styles are considered experimental. While
   they may be attractive to use for easily obtaining machine-readable
   output, their behavior may change in subsequent versions.

   These styles may also exhibit unexpected results when dealing with
   certain encodings. Mercurial treats things like filenames as a
   series of bytes and normalizing certain byte sequences to JSON
   or XML with certain encoding settings can lead to surprises.

Command Server Output
---------------------

If using the command server to interact with Mercurial, you are likely
using an existing library/API that abstracts implementation details of
the command server. If so, this interface layer may perform parsing for
you, saving you the work of implementing it yourself.

Output Verbosity
----------------

Commands often have varying output verbosity, even when machine
readable styles are being used (e.g. ``-T json``). Adding
``-v/--verbose`` and ``--debug`` to the command's arguments can
increase the amount of data exposed by Mercurial.

An alternate way to get the data you need is by explicitly specifying
a template.

Other Topics
============

revsets
   Revisions sets is a functional query language for selecting a set
   of revisions. Think of it as SQL for Mercurial repositories. Revsets
   are useful for querying repositories for specific data.

   See :hg:`help revsets` for more.

share extension
   The ``share`` extension provides functionality for sharing
   repository data across several working copies. It can even
   automatically "pool" storage for logically related repositories when
   cloning.

   Configuring the ``share`` extension can lead to significant resource
   utilization reduction, particularly around disk space and the
   network. This is especially true for continuous integration (CI)
   environments.

   See :hg:`help -e share` for more.

.. _subrepos:
.. _subrepo:

Subrepositories
"""""""""""""""

Subrepositories let you nest external repositories or projects into a
parent Mercurial repository, and make commands operate on them as a
group.

Mercurial currently supports Mercurial, Git, and Subversion
subrepositories.

Subrepositories are made of three components:

1. Nested repository checkouts. They can appear anywhere in the
   parent working directory.

2. Nested repository references. They are defined in ``.hgsub``, which
   should be placed in the root of working directory, and
   tell where the subrepository checkouts come from. Mercurial
   subrepositories are referenced like::

     path/to/nested = https://example.com/nested/repo/path

   Git and Subversion subrepos are also supported::

     path/to/nested = [git]git://example.com/nested/repo/path
     path/to/nested = [svn]https://example.com/nested/trunk/path

   where ``path/to/nested`` is the checkout location relatively to the
   parent Mercurial root, and ``https://example.com/nested/repo/path``
   is the source repository path. The source can also reference a
   filesystem path.

   Note that ``.hgsub`` does not exist by default in Mercurial
   repositories, you have to create and add it to the parent
   repository before using subrepositories.

3. Nested repository states. They are defined in ``.hgsubstate``, which
   is placed in the root of working directory, and
   capture whatever information is required to restore the
   subrepositories to the state they were committed in a parent
   repository changeset. Mercurial automatically record the nested
   repositories states when committing in the parent repository.

   .. note::

      The ``.hgsubstate`` file should not be edited manually.


Adding a Subrepository
======================

If ``.hgsub`` does not exist, create it and add it to the parent
repository. Clone or checkout the external projects where you want it
to live in the parent repository. Edit ``.hgsub`` and add the
subrepository entry as described above. At this point, the
subrepository is tracked and the next commit will record its state in
``.hgsubstate`` and bind it to the committed changeset.

Synchronizing a Subrepository
=============================

Subrepos do not automatically track the latest changeset of their
sources. Instead, they are updated to the changeset that corresponds
with the changeset checked out in the top-level changeset. This is so
developers always get a consistent set of compatible code and
libraries when they update.

Thus, updating subrepos is a manual process. Simply check out target
subrepo at the desired revision, test in the top-level repo, then
commit in the parent repository to record the new combination.

Deleting a Subrepository
========================

To remove a subrepository from the parent repository, delete its
reference from ``.hgsub``, then remove its files.

Interaction with Mercurial Commands
===================================

:add: add does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
    specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a file in a
    subrepo, it will be added even without -S/--subrepos specified.
    Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
    ignored.

:addremove: addremove does not recurse into subrepos unless
    -S/--subrepos is specified.  However, if you specify the full
    path of a directory in a subrepo, addremove will be performed on
    it even without -S/--subrepos being specified.  Git and
    Subversion subrepositories will print a warning and continue.

:archive: archive does not recurse in subrepositories unless
    -S/--subrepos is specified.

:cat: cat currently only handles exact file matches in subrepos.
    Subversion subrepositories are currently ignored.

:commit: commit creates a consistent snapshot of the state of the
    entire project and its subrepositories. If any subrepositories
    have been modified, Mercurial will abort.  Mercurial can be made
    to instead commit all modified subrepositories by specifying
    -S/--subrepos, or setting "ui.commitsubrepos=True" in a
    configuration file (see :hg:`help config`).  After there are no
    longer any modified subrepositories, it records their state and
    finally commits it in the parent repository.  The --addremove
    option also honors the -S/--subrepos option.  However, Git and
    Subversion subrepositories will print a warning and abort.

:diff: diff does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
    specified. Changes are displayed as usual, on the subrepositories
    elements. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

:files: files does not recurse into subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
    specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a file or
    directory in a subrepo, it will be displayed even without
    -S/--subrepos being specified.  Git and Subversion subrepositories
    are currently silently ignored.

:forget: forget currently only handles exact file matches in subrepos.
    Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

:incoming: incoming does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos
    is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently
    silently ignored.

:outgoing: outgoing does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos
    is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently
    silently ignored.

:pull: pull is not recursive since it is not clear what to pull prior
    to running :hg:`update`. Listing and retrieving all
    subrepositories changes referenced by the parent repository pulled
    changesets is expensive at best, impossible in the Subversion
    case.

:push: Mercurial will automatically push all subrepositories first
    when the parent repository is being pushed. This ensures new
    subrepository changes are available when referenced by top-level
    repositories.  Push is a no-op for Subversion subrepositories.

:status: status does not recurse into subrepositories unless
    -S/--subrepos is specified. Subrepository changes are displayed as
    regular Mercurial changes on the subrepository
    elements. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
    ignored.

:remove: remove does not recurse into subrepositories unless
    -S/--subrepos is specified.  However, if you specify a file or
    directory path in a subrepo, it will be removed even without
    -S/--subrepos.  Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently
    silently ignored.

:update: update restores the subrepos in the state they were
    originally committed in target changeset. If the recorded
    changeset is not available in the current subrepository, Mercurial
    will pull it in first before updating.  This means that updating
    can require network access when using subrepositories.

Remapping Subrepositories Sources
=================================

A subrepository source location may change during a project life,
invalidating references stored in the parent repository history. To
fix this, rewriting rules can be defined in parent repository ``hgrc``
file or in Mercurial configuration. See the ``[subpaths]`` section in
hgrc(5) for more details.

Template Usage
""""""""""""""

Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through
templates. You can either pass in a template or select an existing
template-style from the command line, via the --template option.

You can customize output for any "log-like" command: log,
outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, and heads.

Some built-in styles are packaged with Mercurial. These can be listed
with :hg:`log --template list`. Example usage::

    $ hg log -r1.0::1.1 --template changelog

A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable
expansion::

    $ hg log -r1 --template "{node}\n"
    b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746

Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of
keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These
keywords are usually available for templating a log-like command:

:activebookmark: String. The active bookmark, if it is
  associated with the changeset

:author: String. The unmodified author of the changeset.

:bisect: String. The changeset bisection status.

:bookmarks: List of strings. Any bookmarks associated with the
  changeset. Also sets 'active', the name of the active bookmark.

:branch: String. The name of the branch on which the changeset was
  committed.

:changessincelatesttag: Integer. All ancestors not in the latest tag.

:children: List of strings. The children of the changeset.

:date: Date information. The date when the changeset was committed.

:desc: String. The text of the changeset description.

:diffstat: String. Statistics of changes with the following format:
  "modified files: +added/-removed lines"

:extras: List of dicts with key, value entries of the 'extras'
  field of this changeset.

:file_adds: List of strings. Files added by this changeset.

:file_copies: List of strings. Files copied in this changeset with
  their sources.

:file_copies_switch: List of strings. Like "file_copies" but displayed
  only if the --copied switch is set.

:file_dels: List of strings. Files removed by this changeset.

:file_mods: List of strings. Files modified by this changeset.

:files: List of strings. All files modified, added, or removed by this
  changeset.

:latesttag: List of strings. The global tags on the most recent globally
  tagged ancestor of this changeset.

:latesttagdistance: Integer. Longest path to the latest tag.

:node: String. The changeset identification hash, as a 40 hexadecimal
  digit string.

:p1node: String. The identification hash of the changeset's first parent,
  as a 40 digit hexadecimal string. If the changeset has no parents, all
  digits are 0.

:p1rev: Integer. The repository-local revision number of the changeset's
  first parent, or -1 if the changeset has no parents.

:p2node: String. The identification hash of the changeset's second
  parent, as a 40 digit hexadecimal string. If the changeset has no second
  parent, all digits are 0.

:p2rev: Integer. The repository-local revision number of the changeset's
  second parent, or -1 if the changeset has no second parent.

:parents: List of strings. The parents of the changeset in "rev:node"
  format. If the changeset has only one "natural" parent (the predecessor
  revision) nothing is shown.

:phase: String. The changeset phase name.

:phaseidx: Integer. The changeset phase index.

:rev: Integer. The repository-local changeset revision number.

:subrepos: List of strings. Updated subrepositories in the changeset.

:tags: List of strings. Any tags associated with the changeset.

The "date" keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you
want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process
it. Filters are functions which return a string based on the input
variable. Be sure to use the stringify filter first when you're
applying a string-input filter to a list-like input variable.
You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired output::

   $ hg tip --template "{date|isodate}\n"
   2008-08-21 18:22 +0000

List of filters:

:addbreaks: Any text. Add an XHTML "<br />" tag before the end of
  every line except the last.

:age: Date. Returns a human-readable date/time difference between the
  given date/time and the current date/time.

:basename: Any text. Treats the text as a path, and returns the last
  component of the path after splitting by the path separator
  (ignoring trailing separators). For example, "foo/bar/baz" becomes
  "baz" and "foo/bar//" becomes "bar".

:count: List or text. Returns the length as an integer.

:domain: Any text. Finds the first string that looks like an email
  address, and extracts just the domain component. Example: ``User
  <user@example.com>`` becomes ``example.com``.

:email: Any text. Extracts the first string that looks like an email
  address. Example: ``User <user@example.com>`` becomes
  ``user@example.com``.

:emailuser: Any text. Returns the user portion of an email address.

:escape: Any text. Replaces the special XML/XHTML characters "&", "<"
  and ">" with XML entities, and filters out NUL characters.

:fill68: Any text. Wraps the text to fit in 68 columns.

:fill76: Any text. Wraps the text to fit in 76 columns.

:firstline: Any text. Returns the first line of text.

:hex: Any text. Convert a binary Mercurial node identifier into
  its long hexadecimal representation.

:hgdate: Date. Returns the date as a pair of numbers: "1157407993
  25200" (Unix timestamp, timezone offset).

:isodate: Date. Returns the date in ISO 8601 format: "2009-08-18 13:00
  +0200".

:isodatesec: Date. Returns the date in ISO 8601 format, including
  seconds: "2009-08-18 13:00:13 +0200". See also the rfc3339date
  filter.

:lower: Any text. Converts the text to lowercase.

:nonempty: Any text. Returns '(none)' if the string is empty.

:obfuscate: Any text. Returns the input text rendered as a sequence of
  XML entities.

:person: Any text. Returns the name before an email address,
  interpreting it as per RFC 5322.
  

:revescape: Any text. Escapes all "special" characters, except @.
  Forward slashes are escaped twice to prevent web servers from prematurely
  unescaping them. For example, "@foo bar/baz" becomes "@foo%20bar%252Fbaz".

:rfc3339date: Date. Returns a date using the Internet date format
  specified in RFC 3339: "2009-08-18T13:00:13+02:00".

:rfc822date: Date. Returns a date using the same format used in email
  headers: "Tue, 18 Aug 2009 13:00:13 +0200".

:short: Changeset hash. Returns the short form of a changeset hash,
  i.e. a 12 hexadecimal digit string.

:shortbisect: Any text. Treats `text` as a bisection status, and
  returns a single-character representing the status (G: good, B: bad,
  S: skipped, U: untested, I: ignored). Returns single space if `text`
  is not a valid bisection status.

:shortdate: Date. Returns a date like "2006-09-18".

:splitlines: Any text. Split text into a list of lines.

:stringify: Any type. Turns the value into text by converting values into
  text and concatenating them.

:stripdir: Treat the text as path and strip a directory level, if
  possible. For example, "foo" and "foo/bar" becomes "foo".

:tabindent: Any text. Returns the text, with every non-empty line
  except the first starting with a tab character.

:upper: Any text. Converts the text to uppercase.

:urlescape: Any text. Escapes all "special" characters. For example,
  "foo bar" becomes "foo%20bar".

:user: Any text. Returns a short representation of a user name or email
  address.

Note that a filter is nothing more than a function call, i.e.
``expr|filter`` is equivalent to ``filter(expr)``.

In addition to filters, there are some basic built-in functions:

:date(date[, fmt]): Format a date. See :hg:`help dates` for formatting
  strings. The default is a Unix date format, including the timezone:
  "Mon Sep 04 15:13:13 2006 0700".

:diff([includepattern [, excludepattern]]): Show a diff, optionally
  specifying files to include or exclude.

:fill(text[, width[, initialident[, hangindent]]]): Fill many
  paragraphs with optional indentation. See the "fill" filter.

:get(dict, key): Get an attribute/key from an object. Some keywords
  are complex types. This function allows you to obtain the value of an
  attribute on these types.

:if(expr, then[, else]): Conditionally execute based on the result of
  an expression.

:ifcontains(search, thing, then[, else]): Conditionally execute based
  on whether the item "search" is in "thing".

:ifeq(expr1, expr2, then[, else]): Conditionally execute based on
  whether 2 items are equivalent.

:indent(text, indentchars[, firstline]): Indents all non-empty lines
  with the characters given in the indentchars string. An optional
  third parameter will override the indent for the first line only
  if present.

:join(list, sep): Join items in a list with a delimiter.

:label(label, expr): Apply a label to generated content. Content with
  a label applied can result in additional post-processing, such as
  automatic colorization.

:latesttag([pattern]): The global tags matching the given pattern on the
  most recent globally tagged ancestor of this changeset.

:localdate(date[, tz]): Converts a date to the specified timezone.
  The default is local date.

:pad(text, width[, fillchar=' '[, right=False]]): Pad text with a
  fill character.

:revset(query[, formatargs...]): Execute a revision set query. See
  :hg:`help revset`.

:rstdoc(text, style): Format ReStructuredText.

:shortest(node, minlength=4): Obtain the shortest representation of
  a node.

:startswith(pattern, text): Returns the value from the "text" argument
  if it begins with the content from the "pattern" argument.

:strip(text[, chars]): Strip characters from a string. By default,
  strips all leading and trailing whitespace.

:sub(pattern, replacement, expression): Perform text substitution
  using regular expressions.

:word(number, text[, separator]): Return the nth word from a string.

Also, for any expression that returns a list, there is a list operator:

- expr % "{template}"

As seen in the above example, "{template}" is interpreted as a template.
To prevent it from being interpreted, you can use an escape character "\{"
or a raw string prefix, "r'...'".

Some sample command line templates:

- Format lists, e.g. files::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "files:\n{files % '  {file}\n'}"

- Join the list of files with a ", "::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "files: {join(files, ', ')}\n"

- Modify each line of a commit description::

   $ hg log --template "{splitlines(desc) % '**** {line}\n'}"

- Format date::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "{date(date, '%Y')}\n"

- Display date in UTC::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "{localdate(date, 'UTC')|date}\n"

- Output the description set to a fill-width of 30::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "{fill(desc, 30)}"

- Use a conditional to test for the default branch::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "{ifeq(branch, 'default', 'on the main branch',
   'on branch {branch}')}\n"

- Append a newline if not empty::

   $ hg tip --template "{if(author, '{author}\n')}"

- Label the output for use with the color extension::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "{label('changeset.{phase}', node|short)}\n"

- Invert the firstline filter, i.e. everything but the first line::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "{sub(r'^.*\n?\n?', '', desc)}\n"

- Display the contents of the 'extra' field, one per line::

   $ hg log -r 0 --template "{join(extras, '\n')}\n"

- Mark the active bookmark with '*'::

   $ hg log --template "{bookmarks % '{bookmark}{ifeq(bookmark, active, '*')} '}\n"

- Find the previous release candidate tag, the distance and changes since the tag::

   $ hg log -r . --template "{latesttag('re:^.*-rc$') % '{tag}, {changes}, {distance}'}\n"

- Mark the working copy parent with '@'::

   $ hg log --template "{ifcontains(rev, revset('.'), '@')}\n"

- Show details of parent revisions::

   $ hg log --template "{revset('parents(%d)', rev) % '{desc|firstline}\n'}"

- Show only commit descriptions that start with "template"::

   $ hg log --template "{startswith('template', firstline(desc))}\n"

- Print the first word of each line of a commit message::

   $ hg log --template "{word(0, desc)}\n"

.. _urls:

URL Paths
"""""""""

Valid URLs are of the form::

  local/filesystem/path[#revision]
  file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
  http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
  https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
  ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]

Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
repositories or to bundle files (as created by :hg:`bundle` or
:hg:`incoming --bundle`). See also :hg:`help paths`.

An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag, or
changeset to use from the remote repository. See also :hg:`help
revisions`.

Some features, such as pushing to http:// and https:// URLs are only
possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote Mercurial
server.

Note that the security of HTTPS URLs depends on proper configuration of
web.cacerts.

Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:

- SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
  and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.
- path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default. Use
  an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path::

    ssh://example.com//tmp/repository

- Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
  to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.::

    Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
      Compression no
    Host *
      Compression yes

  Alternatively specify "ssh -C" as your ssh command in your
  configuration file or with the --ssh command line option.

These URLs can all be stored in your configuration file with path
aliases under the [paths] section like so::

  [paths]
  alias1 = URL1
  alias2 = URL2
  ...

You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for
example :hg:`pull alias1` will be treated as :hg:`pull URL1`).

Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when
you do not provide the URL to a command:

default:
  When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves
  the location of the source repository as the new repository's
  'default' path. This is then used when you omit path from push- and
  pull-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).

default-push:
  The push command will look for a path named 'default-push', and
  prefer it over 'default' if both are defined.

acl
===

hooks for controlling repository access

This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to given
branches and paths of a repository when receiving incoming changesets
via pretxnchangegroup and pretxncommit.

The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the
system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original
changeset (since the latter is merely informative).

The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh,
preventing authenticating users from doing anything other than pushing
or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users have interactive
shell access, as they can then disable the hook. Nor is it safe if
remote users share an account, because then there is no way to
distinguish them.

The order in which access checks are performed is:

1) Deny  list for branches (section ``acl.deny.branches``)
2) Allow list for branches (section ``acl.allow.branches``)
3) Deny  list for paths    (section ``acl.deny``)
4) Allow list for paths    (section ``acl.allow``)

The allow and deny sections take key-value pairs.

Branch-based Access Control
---------------------------

Use the ``acl.deny.branches`` and ``acl.allow.branches`` sections to
have branch-based access control. Keys in these sections can be
either:

- a branch name, or
- an asterisk, to match any branch;

The corresponding values can be either:

- a comma-separated list containing users and groups, or
- an asterisk, to match anyone;

You can add the "!" prefix to a user or group name to invert the sense
of the match.

Path-based Access Control
-------------------------

Use the ``acl.deny`` and ``acl.allow`` sections to have path-based
access control. Keys in these sections accept a subtree pattern (with
a glob syntax by default). The corresponding values follow the same
syntax as the other sections above.

Groups
------

Group names must be prefixed with an ``@`` symbol. Specifying a group
name has the same effect as specifying all the users in that group.

You can define group members in the ``acl.groups`` section.
If a group name is not defined there, and Mercurial is running under
a Unix-like system, the list of users will be taken from the OS.
Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

Example Configuration
---------------------

::

  [hooks]

  # Use this if you want to check access restrictions at commit time
  pretxncommit.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

  # Use this if you want to check access restrictions for pull, push,
  # bundle and serve.
  pretxnchangegroup.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

  [acl]
  # Allow or deny access for incoming changes only if their source is
  # listed here, let them pass otherwise. Source is "serve" for all
  # remote access (http or ssh), "push", "pull" or "bundle" when the
  # related commands are run locally.
  # Default: serve
  sources = serve

  [acl.deny.branches]

  # Everyone is denied to the frozen branch:
  frozen-branch = *

  # A bad user is denied on all branches:
  * = bad-user

  [acl.allow.branches]

  # A few users are allowed on branch-a:
  branch-a = user-1, user-2, user-3

  # Only one user is allowed on branch-b:
  branch-b = user-1

  # The super user is allowed on any branch:
  * = super-user

  # Everyone is allowed on branch-for-tests:
  branch-for-tests = *

  [acl.deny]
  # This list is checked first. If a match is found, acl.allow is not
  # checked. All users are granted access if acl.deny is not present.
  # Format for both lists: glob pattern = user, ..., @group, ...

  # To match everyone, use an asterisk for the user:
  # my/glob/pattern = *

  # user6 will not have write access to any file:
  ** = user6

  # Group "hg-denied" will not have write access to any file:
  ** = @hg-denied

  # Nobody will be able to change "DONT-TOUCH-THIS.txt", despite
  # everyone being able to change all other files. See below.
  src/main/resources/DONT-TOUCH-THIS.txt = *

  [acl.allow]
  # if acl.allow is not present, all users are allowed by default
  # empty acl.allow = no users allowed

  # User "doc_writer" has write access to any file under the "docs"
  # folder:
  docs/** = doc_writer

  # User "jack" and group "designers" have write access to any file
  # under the "images" folder:
  images/** = jack, @designers

  # Everyone (except for "user6" and "@hg-denied" - see acl.deny above)
  # will have write access to any file under the "resources" folder
  # (except for 1 file. See acl.deny):
  src/main/resources/** = *

  .hgtags = release_engineer

Examples using the "!" prefix
.............................

Suppose there's a branch that only a given user (or group) should be able to
push to, and you don't want to restrict access to any other branch that may
be created.

The "!" prefix allows you to prevent anyone except a given user or group to
push changesets in a given branch or path.

In the examples below, we will:
1) Deny access to branch "ring" to anyone but user "gollum"
2) Deny access to branch "lake" to anyone but members of the group "hobbit"
3) Deny access to a file to anyone but user "gollum"

::

  [acl.allow.branches]
  # Empty

  [acl.deny.branches]

  # 1) only 'gollum' can commit to branch 'ring';
  # 'gollum' and anyone else can still commit to any other branch.
  ring = !gollum

  # 2) only members of the group 'hobbit' can commit to branch 'lake';
  # 'hobbit' members and anyone else can still commit to any other branch.
  lake = !@hobbit

  # You can also deny access based on file paths:

  [acl.allow]
  # Empty

  [acl.deny]
  # 3) only 'gollum' can change the file below;
  # 'gollum' and anyone else can still change any other file.
  /misty/mountains/cave/ring = !gollum

bugzilla
========

hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker

This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when changesets
that refer to bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The comment is formatted using
the Mercurial template mechanism.

The bug references can optionally include an update for Bugzilla of the
hours spent working on the bug. Bugs can also be marked fixed.

Three basic modes of access to Bugzilla are provided:

1. Access via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.

2. Check data via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface and submit bug change
   via email to Bugzilla email interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.

3. Writing directly to the Bugzilla database. Only Bugzilla installations
   using MySQL are supported. Requires Python MySQLdb.

Writing directly to the database is susceptible to schema changes, and
relies on a Bugzilla contrib script to send out bug change
notification emails. This script runs as the user running Mercurial,
must be run on the host with the Bugzilla install, and requires
permission to read Bugzilla configuration details and the necessary
MySQL user and password to have full access rights to the Bugzilla
database. For these reasons this access mode is now considered
deprecated, and will not be updated for new Bugzilla versions going
forward. Only adding comments is supported in this access mode.

Access via XMLRPC needs a Bugzilla username and password to be specified
in the configuration. Comments are added under that username. Since the
configuration must be readable by all Mercurial users, it is recommended
that the rights of that user are restricted in Bugzilla to the minimum
necessary to add comments. Marking bugs fixed requires Bugzilla 4.0 and later.

Access via XMLRPC/email uses XMLRPC to query Bugzilla, but sends
email to the Bugzilla email interface to submit comments to bugs.
The From: address in the email is set to the email address of the Mercurial
user, so the comment appears to come from the Mercurial user. In the event
that the Mercurial user email is not recognized by Bugzilla as a Bugzilla
user, the email associated with the Bugzilla username used to log into
Bugzilla is used instead as the source of the comment. Marking bugs fixed
works on all supported Bugzilla versions.

Configuration items common to all access modes:

bugzilla.version
  The access type to use. Values recognized are:

bugzilla.regexp
  Regular expression to match bug IDs for update in changeset commit message.
  It must contain one "()" named group ``<ids>`` containing the bug
  IDs separated by non-digit characters. It may also contain
  a named group ``<hours>`` with a floating-point number giving the
  hours worked on the bug. If no named groups are present, the first
  "()" group is assumed to contain the bug IDs, and work time is not
  updated. The default expression matches ``Bug 1234``, ``Bug no. 1234``,
  ``Bug number 1234``, ``Bugs 1234,5678``, ``Bug 1234 and 5678`` and
  variations thereof, followed by an hours number prefixed by ``h`` or
  ``hours``, e.g. ``hours 1.5``. Matching is case insensitive.

bugzilla.fixregexp
  Regular expression to match bug IDs for marking fixed in changeset
  commit message. This must contain a "()" named group ``<ids>` containing
  the bug IDs separated by non-digit characters. It may also contain
  a named group ``<hours>`` with a floating-point number giving the
  hours worked on the bug. If no named groups are present, the first
  "()" group is assumed to contain the bug IDs, and work time is not
  updated. The default expression matches ``Fixes 1234``, ``Fixes bug 1234``,
  ``Fixes bugs 1234,5678``, ``Fixes 1234 and 5678`` and
  variations thereof, followed by an hours number prefixed by ``h`` or
  ``hours``, e.g. ``hours 1.5``. Matching is case insensitive.

bugzilla.fixstatus
  The status to set a bug to when marking fixed. Default ``RESOLVED``.

bugzilla.fixresolution
  The resolution to set a bug to when marking fixed. Default ``FIXED``.

bugzilla.style
  The style file to use when formatting comments.

bugzilla.template
  Template to use when formatting comments. Overrides style if
  specified. In addition to the usual Mercurial keywords, the
  extension specifies:

  :``{bug}``:     The Bugzilla bug ID.
  :``{root}``:    The full pathname of the Mercurial repository.
  :``{webroot}``: Stripped pathname of the Mercurial repository.
  :``{hgweb}``:   Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories.

  Default ``changeset {node|short} in repo {root} refers to bug
  {bug}.\ndetails:\n\t{desc|tabindent}``

bugzilla.strip
  The number of path separator characters to strip from the front of
  the Mercurial repository path (``{root}`` in templates) to produce
  ``{webroot}``. For example, a repository with ``{root}``
  ``/var/local/my-project`` with a strip of 2 gives a value for
  ``{webroot}`` of ``my-project``. Default 0.

web.baseurl
  Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories. Referenced from
  templates as ``{hgweb}``.

Configuration items common to XMLRPC+email and MySQL access modes:

bugzilla.usermap
  Path of file containing Mercurial committer email to Bugzilla user email
  mappings. If specified, the file should contain one mapping per
  line::

    committer = Bugzilla user

  See also the ``[usermap]`` section.

The ``[usermap]`` section is used to specify mappings of Mercurial
committer email to Bugzilla user email. See also ``bugzilla.usermap``.
Contains entries of the form ``committer = Bugzilla user``.

XMLRPC access mode configuration:

bugzilla.bzurl
  The base URL for the Bugzilla installation.
  Default ``http://localhost/bugzilla``.

bugzilla.user
  The username to use to log into Bugzilla via XMLRPC. Default
  ``bugs``.

bugzilla.password
  The password for Bugzilla login.

XMLRPC+email access mode uses the XMLRPC access mode configuration items,
and also:

bugzilla.bzemail
  The Bugzilla email address.

In addition, the Mercurial email settings must be configured. See the
documentation in hgrc(5), sections ``[email]`` and ``[smtp]``.

MySQL access mode configuration:

bugzilla.host
  Hostname of the MySQL server holding the Bugzilla database.
  Default ``localhost``.

bugzilla.db
  Name of the Bugzilla database in MySQL. Default ``bugs``.

  Database connection timeout (seconds). Default 5.

bugzilla.bzuser
  Fallback Bugzilla user name to record comments with, if changeset
  committer cannot be found as a Bugzilla user.

bugzilla.bzdir
   Bugzilla install directory. Used by default notify. Default
   ``/var/www/html/bugzilla``.

bugzilla.notify
  The command to run to get Bugzilla to send bug change notification
  emails. Substitutes from a map with 3 keys, ``bzdir``, ``id`` (bug
  id) and ``user`` (committer bugzilla email). Default depends on
  version; from 2.18 it is "cd %(bzdir)s && perl -T
  contrib/sendbugmail.pl %(id)s %(user)s".

censor
======

erase file content at a given revision

The censor command instructs Mercurial to erase all content of a file at a given
revision *without updating the changeset hash.* This allows existing history to
remain valid while preventing future clones/pulls from receiving the erased
data.

Typical uses for censor are due to security or legal requirements, including::

 * Passwords, private keys, cryptographic material
 * Licensed data/code/libraries for which the license has expired
 * Personally Identifiable Information or other private data

Censored nodes can interrupt mercurial's typical operation whenever the excised
data needs to be materialized. Some commands, like ``hg cat``/``hg revert``,
simply fail when asked to produce censored data. Others, like ``hg verify`` and
``hg update``, must be capable of tolerating censored data to continue to
function in a meaningful way. Such commands only tolerate censored file
revisions if they are allowed by the "censor.policy=ignore" config option.


Commands
--------

censor
......

::

   hg censor -r REV [-t TEXT] [FILE]



Options:

-r, --rev <REV>         censor file from specified revision
-t, --tombstone <TEXT>  replacement tombstone data

children
========

command to display child changesets (DEPRECATED)

This extension is deprecated. You should use :hg:`log -r
"children(REV)"` instead.


Commands
--------

children
........

show the children of the given or working directory revision::

   hg children [-r REV] [FILE]

Print the children of the working directory's revisions. If a
revision is given via -r/--rev, the children of that revision will
be printed. If a file argument is given, revision in which the
file was last changed (after the working directory revision or the
argument to --rev if given) is printed.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV>            show children of the specified revision
--style <STYLE>            display using template map file (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template

churn
=====

command to display statistics about repository history

Commands
--------

churn
.....

histogram of changes to the repository::

   hg churn [-d DATE] [-r REV] [--aliases FILE] [FILE]

This command will display a histogram representing the number
of changed lines or revisions, grouped according to the given
template. The default template will group changes by author.
The --dateformat option may be used to group the results by
date instead.

Statistics are based on the number of changed lines, or
alternatively the number of matching revisions if the
--changesets option is specified.

Examples::

  # display count of changed lines for every committer
  hg churn -t "{author|email}"

  # display daily activity graph
  hg churn -f "%H" -s -c

  # display activity of developers by month
  hg churn -f "%Y-%m" -s -c

  # display count of lines changed in every year
  hg churn -f "%Y" -s

It is possible to map alternate email addresses to a main address
by providing a file using the following format::

  <alias email> = <actual email>

Such a file may be specified with the --aliases option, otherwise
a .hgchurn file will be looked for in the working directory root.
Aliases will be split from the rightmost "=".

Options:

-r, --rev <REV[+]>            count rate for the specified revision or revset
-d, --date <DATE>             count rate for revisions matching date spec
-t, --oldtemplate <TEMPLATE>  template to group changesets (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>     template to group changesets (default: {author|email})
-f, --dateformat <FORMAT>     strftime-compatible format for grouping by date
-c, --changesets              count rate by number of changesets
-s, --sort                    sort by key (default: sort by count)
--diffstat                    display added/removed lines separately
--aliases <FILE>              file with email aliases
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>    include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>    exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

clonebundles
============

advertise pre-generated bundles to seed clones (experimental)

"clonebundles" is a server-side extension used to advertise the existence
of pre-generated, externally hosted bundle files to clients that are
cloning so that cloning can be faster, more reliable, and require less
resources on the server.

Cloning can be a CPU and I/O intensive operation on servers. Traditionally,
the server, in response to a client's request to clone, dynamically generates
a bundle containing the entire repository content and sends it to the client.
There is no caching on the server and the server will have to redundantly
generate the same outgoing bundle in response to each clone request. For
servers with large repositories or with high clone volume, the load from
clones can make scaling the server challenging and costly.

This extension provides server operators the ability to offload potentially
expensive clone load to an external service. Here's how it works.

1. A server operator establishes a mechanism for making bundle files available
   on a hosting service where Mercurial clients can fetch them.
2. A manifest file listing available bundle URLs and some optional metadata
   is added to the Mercurial repository on the server.
3. A client initiates a clone against a clone bundles aware server.
4. The client sees the server is advertising clone bundles and fetches the
   manifest listing available bundles.
5. The client filters and sorts the available bundles based on what it
   supports and prefers.
6. The client downloads and applies an available bundle from the
   server-specified URL.
7. The client reconnects to the original server and performs the equivalent
   of :hg:`pull` to retrieve all repository data not in the bundle. (The
   repository could have been updated between when the bundle was created
   and when the client started the clone.)

Instead of the server generating full repository bundles for every clone
request, it generates full bundles once and they are subsequently reused to
bootstrap new clones. The server may still transfer data at clone time.
However, this is only data that has been added/changed since the bundle was
created. For large, established repositories, this can reduce server load for
clones to less than 1% of original.

To work, this extension requires the following of server operators:

* Generating bundle files of repository content (typically periodically,
  such as once per day).
* A file server that clients have network access to and that Python knows
  how to talk to through its normal URL handling facility (typically a
  HTTP server).
* A process for keeping the bundles manifest in sync with available bundle
  files.

Strictly speaking, using a static file hosting server isn't required: a server
operator could use a dynamic service for retrieving bundle data. However,
static file hosting services are simple and scalable and should be sufficient
for most needs.

Bundle files can be generated with the :hg:`bundle` command. Typically
:hg:`bundle --all` is used to produce a bundle of the entire repository.

:hg:`debugcreatestreamclonebundle` can be used to produce a special
*streaming clone bundle*. These are bundle files that are extremely efficient
to produce and consume (read: fast). However, they are larger than
traditional bundle formats and require that clients support the exact set
of repository data store formats in use by the repository that created them.
Typically, a newer server can serve data that is compatible with older clients.
However, *streaming clone bundles* don't have this guarantee. **Server
operators need to be aware that newer versions of Mercurial may produce
streaming clone bundles incompatible with older Mercurial versions.**

The list of requirements printed by :hg:`debugcreatestreamclonebundle` should
be specified in the ``requirements`` parameter of the *bundle specification
string* for the ``BUNDLESPEC`` manifest property described below. e.g.
``BUNDLESPEC=none-packed1;requirements%3Drevlogv1``.

A server operator is responsible for creating a ``.hg/clonebundles.manifest``
file containing the list of available bundle files suitable for seeding
clones. If this file does not exist, the repository will not advertise the
existence of clone bundles when clients connect.

The manifest file contains a newline (
) delimited list of entries.

Each line in this file defines an available bundle. Lines have the format:

    <URL> [<key>=<value>[ <key>=<value>]]

That is, a URL followed by an optional, space-delimited list of key=value
pairs describing additional properties of this bundle. Both keys and values
are URI encoded.

Keys in UPPERCASE are reserved for use by Mercurial and are defined below.
All non-uppercase keys can be used by site installations. An example use
for custom properties is to use the *datacenter* attribute to define which
data center a file is hosted in. Clients could then prefer a server in the
data center closest to them.

The following reserved keys are currently defined:

BUNDLESPEC
   A "bundle specification" string that describes the type of the bundle.

   These are string values that are accepted by the "--type" argument of
   :hg:`bundle`.

   The values are parsed in strict mode, which means they must be of the
   "<compression>-<type>" form. See
   mercurial.exchange.parsebundlespec() for more details.

   Clients will automatically filter out specifications that are unknown or
   unsupported so they won't attempt to download something that likely won't
   apply.

   The actual value doesn't impact client behavior beyond filtering:
   clients will still sniff the bundle type from the header of downloaded
   files.

   **Use of this key is highly recommended**, as it allows clients to
   easily skip unsupported bundles.

REQUIRESNI
   Whether Server Name Indication (SNI) is required to connect to the URL.
   SNI allows servers to use multiple certificates on the same IP. It is
   somewhat common in CDNs and other hosting providers. Older Python
   versions do not support SNI. Defining this attribute enables clients
   with older Python versions to filter this entry without experiencing
   an opaque SSL failure at connection time.

   If this is defined, it is important to advertise a non-SNI fallback
   URL or clients running old Python releases may not be able to clone
   with the clonebundles facility.

   Value should be "true".

Manifests can contain multiple entries. Assuming metadata is defined, clients
will filter entries from the manifest that they don't support. The remaining
entries are optionally sorted by client preferences
(``experimental.clonebundleprefers`` config option). The client then attempts
to fetch the bundle at the first URL in the remaining list.

**Errors when downloading a bundle will fail the entire clone operation:
clients do not automatically fall back to a traditional clone.** The reason
for this is that if a server is using clone bundles, it is probably doing so
because the feature is necessary to help it scale. In other words, there
is an assumption that clone load will be offloaded to another service and
that the Mercurial server isn't responsible for serving this clone load.
If that other service experiences issues and clients start mass falling back to
the original Mercurial server, the added clone load could overwhelm the server
due to unexpected load and effectively take it offline. Not having clients
automatically fall back to cloning from the original server mitigates this
scenario.

Because there is no automatic Mercurial server fallback on failure of the
bundle hosting service, it is important for server operators to view the bundle
hosting service as an extension of the Mercurial server in terms of
availability and service level agreements: if the bundle hosting service goes
down, so does the ability for clients to clone. Note: clients will see a
message informing them how to bypass the clone bundles facility when a failure
occurs. So server operators should prepare for some people to follow these
instructions when a failure occurs, thus driving more load to the original
Mercurial server when the bundle hosting service fails.

The following config options influence the behavior of the clone bundles
feature:

ui.clonebundleadvertise
   Whether the server advertises the existence of the clone bundles feature
   to compatible clients that aren't using it.

   When this is enabled (the default), a server will send a message to
   compatible clients performing a traditional clone informing them of the
   available clone bundles feature. Compatible clients are those that support
   bundle2 and are advertising support for the clone bundles feature.

ui.clonebundlefallback
   Whether to automatically fall back to a traditional clone in case of
   clone bundles failure. Defaults to false for reasons described above.

experimental.clonebundles
   Whether the clone bundles feature is enabled on clients. Defaults to true.

experimental.clonebundleprefers
   List of "key=value" properties the client prefers in bundles. Downloaded
   bundle manifests will be sorted by the preferences in this list. e.g.
   the value "BUNDLESPEC=gzip-v1, BUNDLESPEC=bzip2=v1" will prefer a gzipped
   version 1 bundle type then bzip2 version 1 bundle type.

   If not defined, the order in the manifest will be used and the first
   available bundle will be downloaded.


color
=====

colorize output from some commands

The color extension colorizes output from several Mercurial commands.
For example, the diff command shows additions in green and deletions
in red, while the status command shows modified files in magenta. Many
other commands have analogous colors. It is possible to customize
these colors.

Effects
-------

Other effects in addition to color, like bold and underlined text, are
also available. By default, the terminfo database is used to find the
terminal codes used to change color and effect.  If terminfo is not
available, then effects are rendered with the ECMA-48 SGR control
function (aka ANSI escape codes).

The available effects in terminfo mode are 'blink', 'bold', 'dim',
'inverse', 'invisible', 'italic', 'standout', and 'underline'; in
ECMA-48 mode, the options are 'bold', 'inverse', 'italic', and
'underline'.  How each is rendered depends on the terminal emulator.
Some may not be available for a given terminal type, and will be
silently ignored.

Labels
------

Text receives color effects depending on the labels that it has. Many
default Mercurial commands emit labelled text. You can also define
your own labels in templates using the label function, see :hg:`help
templates`. A single portion of text may have more than one label. In
that case, effects given to the last label will override any other
effects. This includes the special "none" effect, which nullifies
other effects.

Labels are normally invisible. In order to see these labels and their
position in the text, use the global --color=debug option. The same
anchor text may be associated to multiple labels, e.g.

  [log.changeset changeset.secret|changeset:   22611:6f0a53c8f587]

The following are the default effects for some default labels. Default
effects may be overridden from your configuration file::

  [color]
  status.modified = blue bold underline red_background
  status.added = green bold
  status.removed = red bold blue_background
  status.deleted = cyan bold underline
  status.unknown = magenta bold underline
  status.ignored = black bold

  # 'none' turns off all effects
  status.clean = none
  status.copied = none

  qseries.applied = blue bold underline
  qseries.unapplied = black bold
  qseries.missing = red bold

  diff.diffline = bold
  diff.extended = cyan bold
  diff.file_a = red bold
  diff.file_b = green bold
  diff.hunk = magenta
  diff.deleted = red
  diff.inserted = green
  diff.changed = white
  diff.tab =
  diff.trailingwhitespace = bold red_background

  # Blank so it inherits the style of the surrounding label
  changeset.public =
  changeset.draft =
  changeset.secret =

  resolve.unresolved = red bold
  resolve.resolved = green bold

  bookmarks.active = green

  branches.active = none
  branches.closed = black bold
  branches.current = green
  branches.inactive = none

  tags.normal = green
  tags.local = black bold

  rebase.rebased = blue
  rebase.remaining = red bold

  shelve.age = cyan
  shelve.newest = green bold
  shelve.name = blue bold

  histedit.remaining = red bold

Custom colors
-------------

Because there are only eight standard colors, this module allows you
to define color names for other color slots which might be available
for your terminal type, assuming terminfo mode.  For instance::

  color.brightblue = 12
  color.pink = 207
  color.orange = 202

to set 'brightblue' to color slot 12 (useful for 16 color terminals
that have brighter colors defined in the upper eight) and, 'pink' and
'orange' to colors in 256-color xterm's default color cube.  These
defined colors may then be used as any of the pre-defined eight,
including appending '_background' to set the background to that color.

Modes
-----

By default, the color extension will use ANSI mode (or win32 mode on
Windows) if it detects a terminal. To override auto mode (to enable
terminfo mode, for example), set the following configuration option::

  [color]
  mode = terminfo

Any value other than 'ansi', 'win32', 'terminfo', or 'auto' will
disable color.

Note that on some systems, terminfo mode may cause problems when using
color with the pager extension and less -R. less with the -R option
will only display ECMA-48 color codes, and terminfo mode may sometimes
emit codes that less doesn't understand. You can work around this by
either using ansi mode (or auto mode), or by using less -r (which will
pass through all terminal control codes, not just color control
codes).

On some systems (such as MSYS in Windows), the terminal may support
a different color mode than the pager (activated via the "pager"
extension). It is possible to define separate modes depending on whether
the pager is active::

  [color]
  mode = auto
  pagermode = ansi

If ``pagermode`` is not defined, the ``mode`` will be used.


Commands
--------

convert
=======

import revisions from foreign VCS repositories into Mercurial

Commands
--------

convert
.......

convert a foreign SCM repository to a Mercurial one.::

   hg convert [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST [REVMAP]]

Accepted source formats [identifiers]:

- Mercurial [hg]
- CVS [cvs]
- Darcs [darcs]
- git [git]
- Subversion [svn]
- Monotone [mtn]
- GNU Arch [gnuarch]
- Bazaar [bzr]
- Perforce [p4]

Accepted destination formats [identifiers]:

- Mercurial [hg]
- Subversion [svn] (history on branches is not preserved)

If no revision is given, all revisions will be converted.
Otherwise, convert will only import up to the named revision
(given in a format understood by the source).

If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source with ``-hg`` appended. If the destination
repository doesn't exist, it will be created.

By default, all sources except Mercurial will use --branchsort.
Mercurial uses --sourcesort to preserve original revision numbers
order. Sort modes have the following effects:

--branchsort  convert from parent to child revision when possible,
              which means branches are usually converted one after
              the other. It generates more compact repositories.

--datesort    sort revisions by date. Converted repositories have
              good-looking changelogs but are often an order of
              magnitude larger than the same ones generated by
              --branchsort.

--sourcesort  try to preserve source revisions order, only
              supported by Mercurial sources.

--closesort   try to move closed revisions as close as possible
              to parent branches, only supported by Mercurial
              sources.

If ``REVMAP`` isn't given, it will be put in a default location
(``<dest>/.hg/shamap`` by default). The ``REVMAP`` is a simple
text file that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID
for that revision, like so::

  <source ID> <destination ID>

If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created. It's
updated on each commit copied, so :hg:`convert` can be interrupted
and can be run repeatedly to copy new commits.

The authormap is a simple text file that maps each source commit
author to a destination commit author. It is handy for source SCMs
that use unix logins to identify authors (e.g.: CVS). One line per
author mapping and the line format is::

  source author = destination author

Empty lines and lines starting with a ``#`` are ignored.

The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files
and directories. Each line can contain one of the following
directives::

  include path/to/file-or-dir

  exclude path/to/file-or-dir

  rename path/to/source path/to/destination

Comment lines start with ``#``. A specified path matches if it
equals the full relative name of a file or one of its parent
directories. The ``include`` or ``exclude`` directive with the
longest matching path applies, so line order does not matter.

The ``include`` directive causes a file, or all files under a
directory, to be included in the destination repository. The default
if there are no ``include`` statements is to include everything.
If there are any ``include`` statements, nothing else is included.
The ``exclude`` directive causes files or directories to
be omitted. The ``rename`` directive renames a file or directory if
it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory into the root of
the repository, use ``.`` as the path to rename to.

``--full`` will make sure the converted changesets contain exactly
the right files with the right content. It will make a full
conversion of all files, not just the ones that have
changed. Files that already are correct will not be changed. This
can be used to apply filemap changes when converting
incrementally. This is currently only supported for Mercurial and
Subversion.

The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic
history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is
useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or
graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry
contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two
comma-separated values::

  key parent1, parent2

The key is the revision ID in the source
revision control system whose parents should be modified (same
format as a key in .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs
(in either the source or destination revision control system) that
should be used as the new parents for that node. For example, if
you have merged "release-1.0" into "trunk", then you should
specify the revision on "trunk" as the first parent and the one on
the "release-1.0" branch as the second.

The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when it is
being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in
conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination
to help fix even the most badly mismanaged repositories and turn them
into nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains
lines of the form::

  original_branch_name new_branch_name

where "original_branch_name" is the name of the branch in the
source repository, and "new_branch_name" is the name of the branch
is the destination repository. No whitespace is allowed in the
branch names. This can be used to (for instance) move code in one
repository from "default" to a named branch.

Mercurial Source
################

The Mercurial source recognizes the following configuration
options, which you can set on the command line with ``--config``:

:convert.hg.ignoreerrors: ignore integrity errors when reading.
    Use it to fix Mercurial repositories with missing revlogs, by
    converting from and to Mercurial. Default is False.

:convert.hg.saverev: store original revision ID in changeset
    (forces target IDs to change). It takes a boolean argument and
    defaults to False.

:convert.hg.startrev: specify the initial Mercurial revision.
    The default is 0.

:convert.hg.revs: revset specifying the source revisions to convert.

CVS Source
##########

CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS
to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct
access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course the
repository is ``:local:``. The conversion uses the top level
directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses
CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that unless
a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be
converted, and that any directory reorganization in the CVS
sandbox is ignored.

The following options can be used with ``--config``:

:convert.cvsps.cache: Set to False to disable remote log caching,
    for testing and debugging purposes. Default is True.

:convert.cvsps.fuzz: Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is
    allowed between commits with identical user and log message in
    a single changeset. When very large files were checked in as
    part of a changeset then the default may not be long enough.
    The default is 60.

:convert.cvsps.mergeto: Specify a regular expression to which
    commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
    conversion process will insert a dummy revision merging the
    branch on which this log message occurs to the branch
    indicated in the regex. Default is ``{{mergetobranch
    ([-\w]+)}}``

:convert.cvsps.mergefrom: Specify a regular expression to which
    commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
    conversion process will add the most recent revision on the
    branch indicated in the regex as the second parent of the
    changeset. Default is ``{{mergefrombranch ([-\w]+)}}``

:convert.localtimezone: use local time (as determined by the TZ
    environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default
    is False (use UTC).

:hooks.cvslog: Specify a Python function to be called at the end of
    gathering the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the
    log entries, and can modify the entries in-place, or add or
    delete them.

:hooks.cvschangesets: Specify a Python function to be called after
    the changesets are calculated from the CVS log. The
    function is passed a list with the changeset entries, and can
    modify the changesets in-place, or add or delete them.

An additional "debugcvsps" Mercurial command allows the builtin
changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its
parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see
the command help for more details.

Subversion Source
#################

Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.
By default, the supplied ``svn://repo/path/`` source URL is
converted as a single branch. If ``svn://repo/path/trunk`` exists
it replaces the default branch. If ``svn://repo/path/branches``
exists, its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If
``svn://repo/path/tags`` exists, it is looked for tags referencing
converted branches. Default ``trunk``, ``branches`` and ``tags``
values can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths
relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto
detection.

The following options can be set with ``--config``:

:convert.svn.branches: specify the directory containing branches.
    The default is ``branches``.

:convert.svn.tags: specify the directory containing tags. The
    default is ``tags``.

:convert.svn.trunk: specify the name of the trunk branch. The
    default is ``trunk``.

:convert.localtimezone: use local time (as determined by the TZ
    environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default
    is False (use UTC).

Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,
instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch
conversions are supported.

:convert.svn.startrev: specify start Subversion revision number.
    The default is 0.

Git Source
##########

The Git importer converts commits from all reachable branches (refs
in refs/heads) and remotes (refs in refs/remotes) to Mercurial.
Branches are converted to bookmarks with the same name, with the
leading 'refs/heads' stripped. Git submodules are converted to Git
subrepos in Mercurial.

The following options can be set with ``--config``:

:convert.git.similarity: specify how similar files modified in a
    commit must be to be imported as renames or copies, as a
    percentage between ``0`` (disabled) and ``100`` (files must be
    identical). For example, ``90`` means that a delete/add pair will
    be imported as a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn't
    changed. The default is ``50``.

:convert.git.findcopiesharder: while detecting copies, look at all
    files in the working copy instead of just changed ones. This
    is very expensive for large projects, and is only effective when
    ``convert.git.similarity`` is greater than 0. The default is False.

:convert.git.remoteprefix: remote refs are converted as bookmarks with
    ``convert.git.remoteprefix`` as a prefix followed by a /. The default
    is 'remote'.

:convert.git.skipsubmodules: does not convert root level .gitmodules files
    or files with 160000 mode indicating a submodule. Default is False.

Perforce Source
###############

The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a
client specification as source. It will convert all files in the
source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches
and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then
usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the
target may be named ``...-hg``.

The following options can be set with ``--config``:

:convert.p4.encoding: specify the encoding to use when decoding standard
    output of the Perforce command line tool. The default is default system
    encoding.

:convert.p4.startrev: specify initial Perforce revision (a
    Perforce changelist number).

Mercurial Destination
#####################

The Mercurial destination will recognize Mercurial subrepositories in the
destination directory, and update the .hgsubstate file automatically if the
destination subrepositories contain the <dest>/<sub>/.hg/shamap file.
Converting a repository with subrepositories requires converting a single
repository at a time, from the bottom up.

.. container:: verbose

   An example showing how to convert a repository with subrepositories::

     # so convert knows the type when it sees a non empty destination
     $ hg init converted

     $ hg convert orig/sub1 converted/sub1
     $ hg convert orig/sub2 converted/sub2
     $ hg convert orig converted

The following options are supported:

:convert.hg.clonebranches: dispatch source branches in separate
    clones. The default is False.

:convert.hg.tagsbranch: branch name for tag revisions, defaults to
    ``default``.

:convert.hg.usebranchnames: preserve branch names. The default is
    True.

:convert.hg.sourcename: records the given string as a 'convert_source' extra
    value on each commit made in the target repository. The default is None.

All Destinations
################

All destination types accept the following options:

:convert.skiptags: does not convert tags from the source repo to the target
    repo. The default is False.

Options:

--authors <FILE>          username mapping filename (DEPRECATED) (use --authormap instead)
-s, --source-type <TYPE>  source repository type
-d, --dest-type <TYPE>    destination repository type
-r, --rev <REV[+]>        import up to source revision REV
-A, --authormap <FILE>    remap usernames using this file
--filemap <FILE>          remap file names using contents of file
--full                    apply filemap changes by converting all files again
--splicemap <FILE>        splice synthesized history into place
--branchmap <FILE>        change branch names while converting
--branchsort              try to sort changesets by branches
--datesort                try to sort changesets by date
--sourcesort              preserve source changesets order
--closesort               try to reorder closed revisions

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

eol
===

automatically manage newlines in repository files

This extension allows you to manage the type of line endings (CRLF or
LF) that are used in the repository and in the local working
directory. That way you can get CRLF line endings on Windows and LF on
Unix/Mac, thereby letting everybody use their OS native line endings.

The extension reads its configuration from a versioned ``.hgeol``
configuration file found in the root of the working directory. The
``.hgeol`` file use the same syntax as all other Mercurial
configuration files. It uses two sections, ``[patterns]`` and
``[repository]``.

The ``[patterns]`` section specifies how line endings should be
converted between the working directory and the repository. The format is
specified by a file pattern. The first match is used, so put more
specific patterns first. The available line endings are ``LF``,
``CRLF``, and ``BIN``.

Files with the declared format of ``CRLF`` or ``LF`` are always
checked out and stored in the repository in that format and files
declared to be binary (``BIN``) are left unchanged. Additionally,
``native`` is an alias for checking out in the platform's default line
ending: ``LF`` on Unix (including Mac OS X) and ``CRLF`` on
Windows. Note that ``BIN`` (do nothing to line endings) is Mercurial's
default behavior; it is only needed if you need to override a later,
more general pattern.

The optional ``[repository]`` section specifies the line endings to
use for files stored in the repository. It has a single setting,
``native``, which determines the storage line endings for files
declared as ``native`` in the ``[patterns]`` section. It can be set to
``LF`` or ``CRLF``. The default is ``LF``. For example, this means
that on Windows, files configured as ``native`` (``CRLF`` by default)
will be converted to ``LF`` when stored in the repository. Files
declared as ``LF``, ``CRLF``, or ``BIN`` in the ``[patterns]`` section
are always stored as-is in the repository.

Example versioned ``.hgeol`` file::

  [patterns]
  **.py = native
  **.vcproj = CRLF
  **.txt = native
  Makefile = LF
  **.jpg = BIN

  [repository]
  native = LF

.. note::

   The rules will first apply when files are touched in the working
   directory, e.g. by updating to null and back to tip to touch all files.

The extension uses an optional ``[eol]`` section read from both the
normal Mercurial configuration files and the ``.hgeol`` file, with the
latter overriding the former. You can use that section to control the
overall behavior. There are three settings:

- ``eol.native`` (default ``os.linesep``) can be set to ``LF`` or
  ``CRLF`` to override the default interpretation of ``native`` for
  checkout. This can be used with :hg:`archive` on Unix, say, to
  generate an archive where files have line endings for Windows.

- ``eol.only-consistent`` (default True) can be set to False to make
  the extension convert files with inconsistent EOLs. Inconsistent
  means that there is both ``CRLF`` and ``LF`` present in the file.
  Such files are normally not touched under the assumption that they
  have mixed EOLs on purpose.

- ``eol.fix-trailing-newline`` (default False) can be set to True to
  ensure that converted files end with a EOL character (either ``\n``
  or ``\r\n`` as per the configured patterns).

The extension provides ``cleverencode:`` and ``cleverdecode:`` filters
like the deprecated win32text extension does. This means that you can
disable win32text and enable eol and your filters will still work. You
only need to these filters until you have prepared a ``.hgeol`` file.

The ``win32text.forbid*`` hooks provided by the win32text extension
have been unified into a single hook named ``eol.checkheadshook``. The
hook will lookup the expected line endings from the ``.hgeol`` file,
which means you must migrate to a ``.hgeol`` file first before using
the hook. ``eol.checkheadshook`` only checks heads, intermediate
invalid revisions will be pushed. To forbid them completely, use the
``eol.checkallhook`` hook. These hooks are best used as
``pretxnchangegroup`` hooks.

See :hg:`help patterns` for more information about the glob patterns
used.


extdiff
=======

command to allow external programs to compare revisions

The extdiff Mercurial extension allows you to use external programs
to compare revisions, or revision with working directory. The external
diff programs are called with a configurable set of options and two
non-option arguments: paths to directories containing snapshots of
files to compare.

The extdiff extension also allows you to configure new diff commands, so
you do not need to type :hg:`extdiff -p kdiff3` always. ::

  [extdiff]
  # add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in 'context diff' mode
  cdiff = gdiff -Nprc5
  ## or the old way:
  #cmd.cdiff = gdiff
  #opts.cdiff = -Nprc5

  # add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice).  If
  # the meld executable is not available, the meld tool in [merge-tools]
  # will be used, if available
  meld =

  # add new command called vimdiff, runs gvimdiff with DirDiff plugin
  # (see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102) Non
  # English user, be sure to put "let g:DirDiffDynamicDiffText = 1" in
  # your .vimrc
  vimdiff = gvim -f "+next" \
            "+execute 'DirDiff' fnameescape(argv(0)) fnameescape(argv(1))"

Tool arguments can include variables that are expanded at runtime::

  $parent1, $plabel1 - filename, descriptive label of first parent
  $child,   $clabel  - filename, descriptive label of child revision
  $parent2, $plabel2 - filename, descriptive label of second parent
  $root              - repository root
  $parent is an alias for $parent1.

The extdiff extension will look in your [diff-tools] and [merge-tools]
sections for diff tool arguments, when none are specified in [extdiff].

::

  [extdiff]
  kdiff3 =

  [diff-tools]
  kdiff3.diffargs=--L1 '$plabel1' --L2 '$clabel' $parent $child

You can use -I/-X and list of file or directory names like normal
:hg:`diff` command. The extdiff extension makes snapshots of only
needed files, so running the external diff program will actually be
pretty fast (at least faster than having to compare the entire tree).


Commands
--------

extdiff
.......

use external program to diff repository (or selected files)::

   hg extdiff [OPT]... [FILE]...

Show differences between revisions for the specified files, using
an external program. The default program used is diff, with
default options "-Npru".

To select a different program, use the -p/--program option. The
program will be passed the names of two directories to compare. To
pass additional options to the program, use -o/--option. These
will be passed before the names of the directories to compare.

When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
to its parent.

Options:

-p, --program <CMD>         comparison program to run
-o, --option <OPT[+]>       pass option to comparison program
-r, --rev <REV[+]>          revision
-c, --change <REV>          change made by revision
--patch                     compare patches for two revisions
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

factotum
========

http authentication with factotum

This extension allows the factotum(4) facility on Plan 9 from Bell Labs
platforms to provide authentication information for HTTP access. Configuration
entries specified in the auth section as well as authentication information
provided in the repository URL are fully supported. If no prefix is specified,
a value of "*" will be assumed.

By default, keys are specified as::

  proto=pass service=hg prefix=<prefix> user=<username> !password=<password>

If the factotum extension is unable to read the required key, one will be
requested interactively.

A configuration section is available to customize runtime behavior. By
default, these entries are::

  [factotum]
  executable = /bin/auth/factotum
  mountpoint = /mnt/factotum
  service = hg

The executable entry defines the full path to the factotum binary. The
mountpoint entry defines the path to the factotum file service. Lastly, the
service entry controls the service name used when reading keys.



fetch
=====

pull, update and merge in one command (DEPRECATED)

Commands
--------

fetch
.....

pull changes from a remote repository, merge new changes if needed.::

   hg fetch [SOURCE]

This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
or URL and adds them to the local repository.

If the pulled changes add a new branch head, the head is
automatically merged, and the result of the merge is committed.
Otherwise, the working directory is updated to include the new
changes.

When a merge is needed, the working directory is first updated to
the newly pulled changes. Local changes are then merged into the
pulled changes. To switch the merge order, use --switch-parent.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV[+]>    a specific revision you would like to pull
-e, --edit            invoke editor on commit messages
--force-editor        edit commit message (DEPRECATED)
--switch-parent       switch parents when merging
-m, --message <TEXT>  use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>  read commit message from file
-d, --date <DATE>     record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>     record the specified user as committer
-e, --ssh <CMD>       specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>     specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure            do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

gpg
===

commands to sign and verify changesets

Commands
--------

sigcheck
........

verify all the signatures there may be for a particular revision::

   hg sigcheck REV

verify all the signatures there may be for a particular revision

sign
....

add a signature for the current or given revision::

   hg sign [OPTION]... [REV]...

If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
or tip if no revision is checked out.

The ``gpg.cmd`` config setting can be used to specify the command
to run. A default key can be specified with ``gpg.key``.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

Options:

-l, --local           make the signature local
-f, --force           sign even if the sigfile is modified
--no-commit           do not commit the sigfile after signing
-k, --key <ID>        the key id to sign with
-m, --message <TEXT>  use text as commit message
-e, --edit            invoke editor on commit messages
-d, --date <DATE>     record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>     record the specified user as committer

sigs
....

list signed changesets::

   hg sigs

list signed changesets

graphlog
========

command to view revision graphs from a shell (DEPRECATED)

The functionality of this extension has been include in core Mercurial
since version 2.3.

This extension adds a --graph option to the incoming, outgoing and log
commands. When this options is given, an ASCII representation of the
revision graph is also shown.


Commands
--------

glog
....

   hg glog [OPTION]... [FILE]

Print a revision history alongside a revision graph drawn with
ASCII characters.

Nodes printed as an @ character are parents of the working
directory.

Options:

-f, --follow                follow changeset history, or file history across copies and renames
--follow-first              only follow the first parent of merge changesets (DEPRECATED)
-d, --date <DATE>           show revisions matching date spec
-C, --copies                show copied files

hgcia
=====

hooks for integrating with the CIA.vc notification service

This is meant to be run as a changegroup or incoming hook. To
configure it, set the following options in your hgrc::

  [cia]
  # your registered CIA user name
  user = foo
  # the name of the project in CIA
  project = foo
  # the module (subproject) (optional)
  #module = foo
  # Append a diffstat to the log message (optional)
  #diffstat = False
  # Template to use for log messages (optional)
  #template = {desc}\n{baseurl}{webroot}/rev/{node}-- {diffstat}
  # Style to use (optional)
  #style = foo
  # The URL of the CIA notification service (optional)
  # You can use mailto: URLs to send by email, e.g.
  # mailto:cia@cia.vc
  # Make sure to set email.from if you do this.
  #url = http://cia.vc/
  # print message instead of sending it (optional)
  #test = False
  # number of slashes to strip for url paths
  #strip = 0

  [hooks]
  # one of these:
  changegroup.cia = python:hgcia.hook
  #incoming.cia = python:hgcia.hook

  [web]
  # If you want hyperlinks (optional)
  baseurl = http://server/path/to/repo


hgk
===

browse the repository in a graphical way

The hgk extension allows browsing the history of a repository in a
graphical way. It requires Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later. (Tcl/Tk is not
distributed with Mercurial.)

hgk consists of two parts: a Tcl script that does the displaying and
querying of information, and an extension to Mercurial named hgk.py,
which provides hooks for hgk to get information. hgk can be found in
the contrib directory, and the extension is shipped in the hgext
repository, and needs to be enabled.

The :hg:`view` command will launch the hgk Tcl script. For this command
to work, hgk must be in your search path. Alternately, you can specify
the path to hgk in your configuration file::

  [hgk]
  path = /location/of/hgk

hgk can make use of the extdiff extension to visualize revisions.
Assuming you had already configured extdiff vdiff command, just add::

  [hgk]
  vdiff=vdiff

Revisions context menu will now display additional entries to fire
vdiff on hovered and selected revisions.


Commands
--------

view
....

start interactive history viewer::

   hg view [-l LIMIT] [REVRANGE]

start interactive history viewer

Options:

-l, --limit <NUM>  limit number of changes displayed

highlight
=========

syntax highlighting for hgweb (requires Pygments)

It depends on the Pygments syntax highlighting library:
http://pygments.org/

There are the following configuration options::

  [web]
  pygments_style = <style> (default: colorful)
  highlightfiles = <fileset> (default: size('<5M'))
  highlightonlymatchfilename = <bool> (default False)

``highlightonlymatchfilename`` will only highlight files if their type could
be identified by their filename. When this is not enabled (the default),
Pygments will try very hard to identify the file type from content and any
match (even matches with a low confidence score) will be used.


histedit
========

interactive history editing

With this extension installed, Mercurial gains one new command: histedit. Usage
is as follows, assuming the following history::

 @  3[tip]   7c2fd3b9020c   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42

If you were to run ``hg histedit c561b4e977df``, you would see the following
file open in your editor::

 pick c561b4e977df Add beta
 pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
 pick 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

 # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
 #
 # Commits are listed from least to most recent
 #
 # Commands:
 #  p, pick = use commit
 #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
 #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
 #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description
 #  d, drop = remove commit from history
 #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
 #

In this file, lines beginning with ``#`` are ignored. You must specify a rule
for each revision in your history. For example, if you had meant to add gamma
before beta, and then wanted to add delta in the same revision as beta, you
would reorganize the file to look like this::

 pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
 pick c561b4e977df Add beta
 fold 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

 # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
 #
 # Commits are listed from least to most recent
 #
 # Commands:
 #  p, pick = use commit
 #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
 #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
 #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description
 #  d, drop = remove commit from history
 #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
 #

At which point you close the editor and ``histedit`` starts working. When you
specify a ``fold`` operation, ``histedit`` will open an editor when it folds
those revisions together, offering you a chance to clean up the commit message::

 Add beta
 ***
 Add delta

Edit the commit message to your liking, then close the editor. For
this example, let's assume that the commit message was changed to
``Add beta and delta.`` After histedit has run and had a chance to
remove any old or temporary revisions it needed, the history looks
like this::

 @  2[tip]   989b4d060121   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
 |    Add beta and delta.
 |
 o  1   081603921c3f   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
 |    Add gamma
 |
 o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
      Add alpha

Note that ``histedit`` does *not* remove any revisions (even its own temporary
ones) until after it has completed all the editing operations, so it will
probably perform several strip operations when it's done. For the above example,
it had to run strip twice. Strip can be slow depending on a variety of factors,
so you might need to be a little patient. You can choose to keep the original
revisions by passing the ``--keep`` flag.

The ``edit`` operation will drop you back to a command prompt,
allowing you to edit files freely, or even use ``hg record`` to commit
some changes as a separate commit. When you're done, any remaining
uncommitted changes will be committed as well. When done, run ``hg
histedit --continue`` to finish this step. You'll be prompted for a
new commit message, but the default commit message will be the
original message for the ``edit`` ed revision.

The ``message`` operation will give you a chance to revise a commit
message without changing the contents. It's a shortcut for doing
``edit`` immediately followed by `hg histedit --continue``.

If ``histedit`` encounters a conflict when moving a revision (while
handling ``pick`` or ``fold``), it'll stop in a similar manner to
``edit`` with the difference that it won't prompt you for a commit
message when done. If you decide at this point that you don't like how
much work it will be to rearrange history, or that you made a mistake,
you can use ``hg histedit --abort`` to abandon the new changes you
have made and return to the state before you attempted to edit your
history.

If we clone the histedit-ed example repository above and add four more
changes, such that we have the following history::

   @  6[tip]   038383181893   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   stefan
   |    Add theta
   |

   |    Add zeta
   |
   o  3   836302820282   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   stefan
   |    Add epsilon
   |
   o  2   989b4d060121   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42

   o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
        Add alpha

If you run ``hg histedit --outgoing`` on the clone then it is the same
as running ``hg histedit 836302820282``. If you need plan to push to a
repository that Mercurial does not detect to be related to the source
repo, you can add a ``--force`` option.

Histedit rule lines are truncated to 80 characters by default. You
can customize this behavior by setting a different length in your
configuration file::

  [histedit]
  linelen = 120      # truncate rule lines at 120 characters


Commands
--------

histedit
........

interactively edit changeset history::

   hg histedit ANCESTOR | --outgoing [URL]

This command edits changesets between ANCESTOR and the parent of
the working directory.

With --outgoing, this edits changesets not found in the
destination repository. If URL of the destination is omitted, the
'default-push' (or 'default') path will be used.

For safety, this command is also aborted if there are ambiguous
outgoing revisions which may confuse users: for example, if there
are multiple branches containing outgoing revisions.

Use "min(outgoing() and ::.)" or similar revset specification
instead of --outgoing to specify edit target revision exactly in
such ambiguous situation. See :hg:`help revsets` for detail about
selecting revisions.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if user intervention is required (not only
for intentional "edit" command, but also for resolving unexpected
conflicts).

Options:

--commands <FILE>   read history edits from the specified file
-c, --continue      continue an edit already in progress
--edit-plan         edit remaining actions list
-k, --keep          don't strip old nodes after edit is complete
--abort             abort an edit in progress
-o, --outgoing      changesets not found in destination
-f, --force         force outgoing even for unrelated repositories
-r, --rev <REV[+]>  first revision to be edited

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

keyword
=======

expand keywords in tracked files

This extension expands RCS/CVS-like or self-customized $Keywords$ in
tracked text files selected by your configuration.

Keywords are only expanded in local repositories and not stored in the
change history. The mechanism can be regarded as a convenience for the
current user or for archive distribution.

Keywords expand to the changeset data pertaining to the latest change
relative to the working directory parent of each file.

Configuration is done in the [keyword], [keywordset] and [keywordmaps]
sections of hgrc files.

Example::

    [keyword]
    # expand keywords in every python file except those matching "x*"
    **.py =
    x*    = ignore

    [keywordset]
    # prefer svn- over cvs-like default keywordmaps
    svn = True

.. note::

   The more specific you are in your filename patterns the less you
   lose speed in huge repositories.

For [keywordmaps] template mapping and expansion demonstration and
control run :hg:`kwdemo`. See :hg:`help templates` for a list of
available templates and filters.

Three additional date template filters are provided:

:``utcdate``:    "2006/09/18 15:13:13"
:``svnutcdate``: "2006-09-18 15:13:13Z"
:``svnisodate``: "2006-09-18 08:13:13 -700 (Mon, 18 Sep 2006)"

The default template mappings (view with :hg:`kwdemo -d`) can be
replaced with customized keywords and templates. Again, run
:hg:`kwdemo` to control the results of your configuration changes.

Before changing/disabling active keywords, you must run :hg:`kwshrink`
to avoid storing expanded keywords in the change history.

To force expansion after enabling it, or a configuration change, run
:hg:`kwexpand`.

Expansions spanning more than one line and incremental expansions,
like CVS' $Log$, are not supported. A keyword template map "Log =
{desc}" expands to the first line of the changeset description.


Commands
--------

kwdemo
......

print [keywordmaps] configuration and an expansion example::

   hg kwdemo [-d] [-f RCFILE] [TEMPLATEMAP]...

Show current, custom, or default keyword template maps and their
expansions.

Extend the current configuration by specifying maps as arguments
and using -f/--rcfile to source an external hgrc file.

Use -d/--default to disable current configuration.

See :hg:`help templates` for information on templates and filters.

Options:

-d, --default        show default keyword template maps
-f, --rcfile <FILE>  read maps from rcfile

kwexpand
........

expand keywords in the working directory::

   hg kwexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Run after (re)enabling keyword expansion.

kwexpand refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

Options:

-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

kwfiles
.......

show files configured for keyword expansion::

   hg kwfiles [OPTION]... [FILE]...

List which files in the working directory are matched by the
[keyword] configuration patterns.

Useful to prevent inadvertent keyword expansion and to speed up
execution by including only files that are actual candidates for
expansion.

See :hg:`help keyword` on how to construct patterns both for
inclusion and exclusion of files.

With -A/--all and -v/--verbose the codes used to show the status
of files are::

  K = keyword expansion candidate
  k = keyword expansion candidate (not tracked)
  I = ignored
  i = ignored (not tracked)

Options:

-A, --all                   show keyword status flags of all files
-i, --ignore                show files excluded from expansion
-u, --unknown               only show unknown (not tracked) files
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

kwshrink
........

revert expanded keywords in the working directory::

   hg kwshrink [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Must be run before changing/disabling active keywords.

kwshrink refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

Options:

-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

largefiles
==========

track large binary files

Large binary files tend to be not very compressible, not very
diffable, and not at all mergeable. Such files are not handled
efficiently by Mercurial's storage format (revlog), which is based on
compressed binary deltas; storing large binary files as regular
Mercurial files wastes bandwidth and disk space and increases
Mercurial's memory usage. The largefiles extension addresses these
problems by adding a centralized client-server layer on top of
Mercurial: largefiles live in a *central store* out on the network
somewhere, and you only fetch the revisions that you need when you
need them.

largefiles works by maintaining a "standin file" in .hglf/ for each
largefile. The standins are small (41 bytes: an SHA-1 hash plus
newline) and are tracked by Mercurial. Largefile revisions are
identified by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, which is written to
the standin. largefiles uses that revision ID to get/put largefile
revisions from/to the central store. This saves both disk space and
bandwidth, since you don't need to retrieve all historical revisions
of large files when you clone or pull.

To start a new repository or add new large binary files, just add
--large to your :hg:`add` command. For example::

  $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomdata count=2000
  $ hg add --large randomdata
  $ hg commit -m 'add randomdata as a largefile'

When you push a changeset that adds/modifies largefiles to a remote
repository, its largefile revisions will be uploaded along with it.
Note that the remote Mercurial must also have the largefiles extension
enabled for this to work.

When you pull a changeset that affects largefiles from a remote
repository, the largefiles for the changeset will by default not be
pulled down. However, when you update to such a revision, any
largefiles needed by that revision are downloaded and cached (if
they have never been downloaded before). One way to pull largefiles
when pulling is thus to use --update, which will update your working
copy to the latest pulled revision (and thereby downloading any new
largefiles).

If you want to pull largefiles you don't need for update yet, then
you can use pull with the `--lfrev` option or the :hg:`lfpull` command.

If you know you are pulling from a non-default location and want to
download all the largefiles that correspond to the new changesets at
the same time, then you can pull with `--lfrev "pulled()"`.

If you just want to ensure that you will have the largefiles needed to
merge or rebase with new heads that you are pulling, then you can pull
with `--lfrev "head(pulled())"` flag to pre-emptively download any largefiles
that are new in the heads you are pulling.

Keep in mind that network access may now be required to update to
changesets that you have not previously updated to. The nature of the
largefiles extension means that updating is no longer guaranteed to
be a local-only operation.

If you already have large files tracked by Mercurial without the
largefiles extension, you will need to convert your repository in
order to benefit from largefiles. This is done with the
:hg:`lfconvert` command::

  $ hg lfconvert --size 10 oldrepo newrepo

In repositories that already have largefiles in them, any new file
over 10MB will automatically be added as a largefile. To change this
threshold, set ``largefiles.minsize`` in your Mercurial config file
to the minimum size in megabytes to track as a largefile, or use the
--lfsize option to the add command (also in megabytes)::

  [largefiles]
  minsize = 2

  $ hg add --lfsize 2

The ``largefiles.patterns`` config option allows you to specify a list
of filename patterns (see :hg:`help patterns`) that should always be
tracked as largefiles::

  [largefiles]
  patterns =
    *.jpg
    re:.*\.(png|bmp)$
    library.zip
    content/audio/*

Files that match one of these patterns will be added as largefiles
regardless of their size.

The ``largefiles.minsize`` and ``largefiles.patterns`` config options
will be ignored for any repositories not already containing a
largefile. To add the first largefile to a repository, you must
explicitly do so with the --large flag passed to the :hg:`add`
command.


Commands
--------

lfconvert
.........

convert a normal repository to a largefiles repository::

   hg lfconvert SOURCE DEST [FILE ...]

Convert repository SOURCE to a new repository DEST, identical to
SOURCE except that certain files will be converted as largefiles:
specifically, any file that matches any PATTERN *or* whose size is
above the minimum size threshold is converted as a largefile. The
size used to determine whether or not to track a file as a
largefile is the size of the first version of the file. The
minimum size can be specified either with --size or in
configuration as ``largefiles.size``.

After running this command you will need to make sure that
largefiles is enabled anywhere you intend to push the new
repository.

Use --to-normal to convert largefiles back to normal files; after
this, the DEST repository can be used without largefiles at all.

Options:

-s, --size <SIZE>  minimum size (MB) for files to be converted as largefiles
--to-normal        convert from a largefiles repo to a normal repo

lfpull
......

pull largefiles for the specified revisions from the specified source::

   hg lfpull -r REV... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]

Pull largefiles that are referenced from local changesets but missing
locally, pulling from a remote repository to the local cache.

If SOURCE is omitted, the 'default' path will be used.
See :hg:`help urls` for more information.

.. container:: verbose

  Some examples:

  - pull largefiles for all branch heads::

      hg lfpull -r "head() and not closed()"

  - pull largefiles on the default branch::

      hg lfpull -r "branch(default)"

Options:

-r, --rev <VALUE[+]>  pull largefiles for these revisions
-e, --ssh <CMD>       specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>     specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure            do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

mq
==

manage a stack of patches

This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial
repository. It manages two stacks of patches - all known patches, and
applied patches (subset of known patches).

Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches
directory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.

Common tasks (use :hg:`help command` for more details)::

  create new patch                          qnew
  import existing patch                     qimport

  print patch series                        qseries
  print applied patches                     qapplied

  add known patch to applied stack          qpush
  remove patch from applied stack           qpop
  refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh

By default, mq will automatically use git patches when required to
avoid losing file mode changes, copy records, binary files or empty
files creations or deletions. This behavior can be configured with::

  [mq]
  git = auto/keep/yes/no

If set to 'keep', mq will obey the [diff] section configuration while
preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to 'yes' or
'no', mq will override the [diff] section and always generate git or
regular patches, possibly losing data in the second case.

It may be desirable for mq changesets to be kept in the secret phase (see
:hg:`help phases`), which can be enabled with the following setting::

  [mq]
  secret = True

You will by default be managing a patch queue named "patches". You can
create other, independent patch queues with the :hg:`qqueue` command.

If the working directory contains uncommitted files, qpush, qpop and
qgoto abort immediately. If -f/--force is used, the changes are
discarded. Setting::

  [mq]
  keepchanges = True

make them behave as if --keep-changes were passed, and non-conflicting
local changes will be tolerated and preserved. If incompatible options
such as -f/--force or --exact are passed, this setting is ignored.

This extension used to provide a strip command. This command now lives
in the strip extension.


Commands
--------

qapplied
........

print the patches already applied::

   hg qapplied [-1] [-s] [PATCH]

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-1, --last     show only the preceding applied patch
-s, --summary  print first line of patch header

qclone
......

clone main and patch repository at same time::

   hg qclone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

If source is local, destination will have no patches applied. If
source is remote, this command can not check if patches are
applied in source, so cannot guarantee that patches are not
applied in destination. If you clone remote repository, be sure
before that it has no patches applied.

Source patch repository is looked for in <src>/.hg/patches by
default. Use -p <url> to change.

The patch directory must be a nested Mercurial repository, as
would be created by :hg:`init --mq`.

Return 0 on success.

Options:

--pull                use pull protocol to copy metadata
-U, --noupdate        do not update the new working directories
--uncompressed        use uncompressed transfer (fast over LAN)
-p, --patches <REPO>  location of source patch repository
-e, --ssh <CMD>       specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd <CMD>     specify hg command to run on the remote side
--insecure            do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts config)

qcommit
.......

commit changes in the queue repository (DEPRECATED)::

   hg qcommit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

This command is deprecated; use :hg:`commit --mq` instead.

Options:

-A, --addremove             mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing
--close-branch              mark a branch head as closed
--amend                     amend the parent of the working directory

-e, --edit                  invoke editor on commit messages
-i, --interactive           use interactive mode
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message <TEXT>        use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>        read commit message from file
-d, --date <DATE>           record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>           record the specified user as committer
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

    aliases: qci

qdelete
.......

remove patches from queue::

   hg qdelete [-k] [PATCH]...

The patches must not be applied, and at least one patch is required. Exact
patch identifiers must be given. With -k/--keep, the patch files are
preserved in the patch directory.

To stop managing a patch and move it into permanent history,
use the :hg:`qfinish` command.

Options:

-k, --keep          keep patch file
-r, --rev <REV[+]>  stop managing a revision (DEPRECATED)

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

    aliases: qremove qrm

qdiff
.....

diff of the current patch and subsequent modifications::

   hg qdiff [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Shows a diff which includes the current patch as well as any
changes which have been made in the working directory since the
last refresh (thus showing what the current patch would become
after a qrefresh).

Use :hg:`diff` if you only want to see the changes made since the
last qrefresh, or :hg:`export qtip` if you want to see changes
made by the current patch without including changes made since the
qrefresh.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-a, --text                  treat all files as text
-g, --git                   use git extended diff format
--nodates                   omit dates from diff headers
--noprefix                  omit a/ and b/ prefixes from filenames
-p, --show-function         show which function each change is in
--reverse                   produce a diff that undoes the changes
-w, --ignore-all-space      ignore white space when comparing lines
-b, --ignore-space-change   ignore changes in the amount of white space
-B, --ignore-blank-lines    ignore changes whose lines are all blank
-U, --unified <NUM>         number of lines of context to show
--stat                      output diffstat-style summary of changes
--root <DIR>                produce diffs relative to subdirectory
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

qfinish
.......

move applied patches into repository history::

   hg qfinish [-a] [REV]...

Finishes the specified revisions (corresponding to applied
patches) by moving them out of mq control into regular repository
history.

Accepts a revision range or the -a/--applied option. If --applied
is specified, all applied mq revisions are removed from mq
control. Otherwise, the given revisions must be at the base of the
stack of applied patches.

This can be especially useful if your changes have been applied to
an upstream repository, or if you are about to push your changes
to upstream.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-a, --applied  finish all applied changesets

qfold
.....

fold the named patches into the current patch::

   hg qfold [-e] [-k] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH...

Patches must not yet be applied. Each patch will be successively
applied to the current patch in the order given. If all the
patches apply successfully, the current patch will be refreshed
with the new cumulative patch, and the folded patches will be
deleted. With -k/--keep, the folded patch files will not be
removed afterwards.

The header for each folded patch will be concatenated with the
current patch header, separated by a line of ``* * *``.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-e, --edit            invoke editor on commit messages
-k, --keep            keep folded patch files
-m, --message <TEXT>  use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>  read commit message from file

qgoto
.....

push or pop patches until named patch is at top of stack::

   hg qgoto [OPTION]... PATCH

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

--keep-changes  tolerate non-conflicting local changes
-f, --force     overwrite any local changes
--no-backup     do not save backup copies of files

qguard
......

set or print guards for a patch::

   hg qguard [-l] [-n] [PATCH] [-- [+GUARD]... [-GUARD]...]

Guards control whether a patch can be pushed. A patch with no
guards is always pushed. A patch with a positive guard ("+foo") is
pushed only if the :hg:`qselect` command has activated it. A patch with
a negative guard ("-foo") is never pushed if the :hg:`qselect` command
has activated it.

With no arguments, print the currently active guards.
With arguments, set guards for the named patch.

.. note::

   Specifying negative guards now requires '--'.

To set guards on another patch::

  hg qguard other.patch -- +2.6.17 -stable

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-l, --list  list all patches and guards
-n, --none  drop all guards

qheader
.......

print the header of the topmost or specified patch::

   hg qheader [PATCH]

Returns 0 on success.

qimport
.......

import a patch or existing changeset::

   hg qimport [-e] [-n NAME] [-f] [-g] [-P] [-r REV]... [FILE]...

The patch is inserted into the series after the last applied
patch. If no patches have been applied, qimport prepends the patch
to the series.

The patch will have the same name as its source file unless you
give it a new one with -n/--name.

You can register an existing patch inside the patch directory with
the -e/--existing flag.

With -f/--force, an existing patch of the same name will be
overwritten.

An existing changeset may be placed under mq control with -r/--rev
(e.g. qimport --rev . -n patch will place the current revision
under mq control). With -g/--git, patches imported with --rev will
use the git diff format. See the diffs help topic for information
on why this is important for preserving rename/copy information
and permission changes. Use :hg:`qfinish` to remove changesets
from mq control.

To import a patch from standard input, pass - as the patch file.
When importing from standard input, a patch name must be specified
using the --name flag.

To import an existing patch while renaming it::

  hg qimport -e existing-patch -n new-name

Returns 0 if import succeeded.

Options:

-e, --existing      import file in patch directory
-n, --name <NAME>   name of patch file
-f, --force         overwrite existing files
-r, --rev <REV[+]>  place existing revisions under mq control
-g, --git           use git extended diff format
-P, --push          qpush after importing

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

qinit
.....

init a new queue repository (DEPRECATED)::

   hg qinit [-c]

The queue repository is unversioned by default. If
-c/--create-repo is specified, qinit will create a separate nested
repository for patches (qinit -c may also be run later to convert
an unversioned patch repository into a versioned one). You can use
qcommit to commit changes to this queue repository.

This command is deprecated. Without -c, it's implied by other relevant
commands. With -c, use :hg:`init --mq` instead.

Options:

-c, --create-repo  create queue repository

qnew
....

create a new patch::

   hg qnew [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH [FILE]...

qnew creates a new patch on top of the currently-applied patch (if
any). The patch will be initialized with any outstanding changes
in the working directory. You may also use -I/--include,
-X/--exclude, and/or a list of files after the patch name to add
only changes to matching files to the new patch, leaving the rest
as uncommitted modifications.

-u/--user and -d/--date can be used to set the (given) user and
date, respectively. -U/--currentuser and -D/--currentdate set user
to current user and date to current date.

-e/--edit, -m/--message or -l/--logfile set the patch header as
well as the commit message. If none is specified, the header is
empty and the commit message is '[mq]: PATCH'.

Use the -g/--git option to keep the patch in the git extended diff
format. Read the diffs help topic for more information on why this
is important for preserving permission changes and copy/rename
information.

Returns 0 on successful creation of a new patch.

Options:

-e, --edit                  invoke editor on commit messages
-f, --force                 import uncommitted changes (DEPRECATED)
-g, --git                   use git extended diff format
-U, --currentuser           add "From: <current user>" to patch
-u, --user <USER>           add "From: <USER>" to patch
-D, --currentdate           add "Date: <current date>" to patch
-d, --date <DATE>           add "Date: <DATE>" to patch
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message <TEXT>        use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>        read commit message from file

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

qnext
.....

print the name of the next pushable patch::

   hg qnext [-s]

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-s, --summary  print first line of patch header

qpop
....

pop the current patch off the stack::

   hg qpop [-a] [-f] [PATCH | INDEX]

Without argument, pops off the top of the patch stack. If given a
patch name, keeps popping off patches until the named patch is at
the top of the stack.

By default, abort if the working directory contains uncommitted
changes. With --keep-changes, abort only if the uncommitted files
overlap with patched files. With -f/--force, backup and discard
changes made to such files.

Return 0 on success.

Options:

-a, --all          pop all patches
-n, --name <NAME>  queue name to pop (DEPRECATED)
--keep-changes     tolerate non-conflicting local changes
-f, --force        forget any local changes to patched files
--no-backup        do not save backup copies of files

qprev
.....

print the name of the preceding applied patch::

   hg qprev [-s]

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-s, --summary  print first line of patch header

qpush
.....

push the next patch onto the stack::

   hg qpush [-f] [-l] [-a] [--move] [PATCH | INDEX]

By default, abort if the working directory contains uncommitted
changes. With --keep-changes, abort only if the uncommitted files
overlap with patched files. With -f/--force, backup and patch over
uncommitted changes.

Return 0 on success.

Options:

--keep-changes     tolerate non-conflicting local changes
-f, --force        apply on top of local changes
-e, --exact        apply the target patch to its recorded parent
-l, --list         list patch name in commit text
-a, --all          apply all patches
-m, --merge        merge from another queue (DEPRECATED)
-n, --name <NAME>  merge queue name (DEPRECATED)
--move             reorder patch series and apply only the patch
--no-backup        do not save backup copies of files

qqueue
......

manage multiple patch queues::

   hg qqueue [OPTION] [QUEUE]

Supports switching between different patch queues, as well as creating
new patch queues and deleting existing ones.

Omitting a queue name or specifying -l/--list will show you the registered
queues - by default the "normal" patches queue is registered. The currently
active queue will be marked with "(active)". Specifying --active will print
only the name of the active queue.

To create a new queue, use -c/--create. The queue is automatically made
active, except in the case where there are applied patches from the
currently active queue in the repository. Then the queue will only be
created and switching will fail.

To delete an existing queue, use --delete. You cannot delete the currently
active queue.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-l, --list    list all available queues
--active      print name of active queue
-c, --create  create new queue
--rename      rename active queue
--delete      delete reference to queue
--purge       delete queue, and remove patch dir

qrefresh
........

update the current patch::

   hg qrefresh [-I] [-X] [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] [-s] [FILE]...

If any file patterns are provided, the refreshed patch will
contain only the modifications that match those patterns; the
remaining modifications will remain in the working directory.

If -s/--short is specified, files currently included in the patch
will be refreshed just like matched files and remain in the patch.

If -e/--edit is specified, Mercurial will start your configured editor for
you to enter a message. In case qrefresh fails, you will find a backup of
your message in ``.hg/last-message.txt``.

hg add/remove/copy/rename work as usual, though you might want to
use git-style patches (-g/--git or [diff] git=1) to track copies
and renames. See the diffs help topic for more information on the
git diff format.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-e, --edit                  invoke editor on commit messages
-g, --git                   use git extended diff format
-s, --short                 refresh only files already in the patch and specified files
-U, --currentuser           add/update author field in patch with current user
-u, --user <USER>           add/update author field in patch with given user
-D, --currentdate           add/update date field in patch with current date
-d, --date <DATE>           add/update date field in patch with given date
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message <TEXT>        use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>        read commit message from file

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

qrename
.......

rename a patch::

   hg qrename PATCH1 [PATCH2]

With one argument, renames the current patch to PATCH1.
With two arguments, renames PATCH1 to PATCH2.

Returns 0 on success.

    aliases: qmv

qrestore
........

restore the queue state saved by a revision (DEPRECATED)::

   hg qrestore [-d] [-u] REV

This command is deprecated, use :hg:`rebase` instead.

Options:

-d, --delete  delete save entry
-u, --update  update queue working directory

qsave
.....

save current queue state (DEPRECATED)::

   hg qsave [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] [-c] [-n NAME] [-e] [-f]

This command is deprecated, use :hg:`rebase` instead.

Options:

-c, --copy            copy patch directory
-n, --name <NAME>     copy directory name
-e, --empty           clear queue status file
-f, --force           force copy
-m, --message <TEXT>  use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>  read commit message from file

qselect
.......

set or print guarded patches to push::

   hg qselect [OPTION]... [GUARD]...

Use the :hg:`qguard` command to set or print guards on patch, then use
qselect to tell mq which guards to use. A patch will be pushed if
it has no guards or any positive guards match the currently
selected guard, but will not be pushed if any negative guards
match the current guard. For example::

    qguard foo.patch -- -stable    (negative guard)
    qguard bar.patch    +stable    (positive guard)
    qselect stable

This activates the "stable" guard. mq will skip foo.patch (because
it has a negative match) but push bar.patch (because it has a
positive match).

With no arguments, prints the currently active guards.
With one argument, sets the active guard.

Use -n/--none to deactivate guards (no other arguments needed).
When no guards are active, patches with positive guards are
skipped and patches with negative guards are pushed.

qselect can change the guards on applied patches. It does not pop
guarded patches by default. Use --pop to pop back to the last
applied patch that is not guarded. Use --reapply (which implies
--pop) to push back to the current patch afterwards, but skip
guarded patches.

Use -s/--series to print a list of all guards in the series file
(no other arguments needed). Use -v for more information.

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-n, --none    disable all guards
-s, --series  list all guards in series file
--pop         pop to before first guarded applied patch
--reapply     pop, then reapply patches

qseries
.......

print the entire series file::

   hg qseries [-ms]

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-m, --missing  print patches not in series
-s, --summary  print first line of patch header

qtop
....

print the name of the current patch::

   hg qtop [-s]

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-s, --summary  print first line of patch header

qunapplied
..........

print the patches not yet applied::

   hg qunapplied [-1] [-s] [PATCH]

Returns 0 on success.

Options:

-1, --first    show only the first patch
-s, --summary  print first line of patch header

notify
======

hooks for sending email push notifications

This extension implements hooks to send email notifications when
changesets are sent from or received by the local repository.

First, enable the extension as explained in :hg:`help extensions`, and
register the hook you want to run. ``incoming`` and ``changegroup`` hooks
are run when changesets are received, while ``outgoing`` hooks are for
changesets sent to another repository::

  [hooks]
  # one email for each incoming changeset
  incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
  # one email for all incoming changesets
  changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

  # one email for all outgoing changesets
  outgoing.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

This registers the hooks. To enable notification, subscribers must
be assigned to repositories. The ``[usersubs]`` section maps multiple
repositories to a given recipient. The ``[reposubs]`` section maps
multiple recipients to a single repository::

  [usersubs]
  # key is subscriber email, value is a comma-separated list of repo patterns
  user@host = pattern

  [reposubs]
  # key is repo pattern, value is a comma-separated list of subscriber emails
  pattern = user@host

A ``pattern`` is a ``glob`` matching the absolute path to a repository,
optionally combined with a revset expression. A revset expression, if
present, is separated from the glob by a hash. Example::

  [reposubs]
  */widgets#branch(release) = qa-team@example.com

This sends to ``qa-team@example.com`` whenever a changeset on the ``release``
branch triggers a notification in any repository ending in ``widgets``.

In order to place them under direct user management, ``[usersubs]`` and
``[reposubs]`` sections may be placed in a separate ``hgrc`` file and
incorporated by reference::

  [notify]
  config = /path/to/subscriptionsfile

Notifications will not be sent until the ``notify.test`` value is set
to ``False``; see below.

Notifications content can be tweaked with the following configuration entries:

notify.test
  If ``True``, print messages to stdout instead of sending them. Default: True.

notify.sources
  Space-separated list of change sources. Notifications are activated only
  when a changeset's source is in this list. Sources may be:

  :``serve``: changesets received via http or ssh
  :``pull``: changesets received via ``hg pull``
  :``unbundle``: changesets received via ``hg unbundle``
  :``push``: changesets sent or received via ``hg push``
  :``bundle``: changesets sent via ``hg unbundle``

  Default: serve.

notify.strip
  Number of leading slashes to strip from url paths. By default, notifications
  reference repositories with their absolute path. ``notify.strip`` lets you
  turn them into relative paths. For example, ``notify.strip=3`` will change
  ``/long/path/repository`` into ``repository``. Default: 0.

notify.domain
  Default email domain for sender or recipients with no explicit domain.

notify.style
  Style file to use when formatting emails.

notify.template
  Template to use when formatting emails.

notify.incoming
  Template to use when run as an incoming hook, overriding ``notify.template``.

notify.outgoing
  Template to use when run as an outgoing hook, overriding ``notify.template``.

notify.changegroup
  Template to use when running as a changegroup hook, overriding
  ``notify.template``.

notify.maxdiff
  Maximum number of diff lines to include in notification email. Set to 0
  to disable the diff, or -1 to include all of it. Default: 300.

notify.maxsubject
  Maximum number of characters in email's subject line. Default: 67.

notify.diffstat
  Set to True to include a diffstat before diff content. Default: True.

notify.merge
  If True, send notifications for merge changesets. Default: True.

notify.mbox
  If set, append mails to this mbox file instead of sending. Default: None.

notify.fromauthor
  If set, use the committer of the first changeset in a changegroup for
  the "From" field of the notification mail. If not set, take the user
  from the pushing repo.  Default: False.

If set, the following entries will also be used to customize the
notifications:

email.from
  Email ``From`` address to use if none can be found in the generated
  email content.

web.baseurl
  Root repository URL to combine with repository paths when making
  references. See also ``notify.strip``.



pager
=====

browse command output with an external pager

To set the pager that should be used, set the application variable::

  [pager]
  pager = less -FRX

If no pager is set, the pager extensions uses the environment variable
$PAGER. If neither pager.pager, nor $PAGER is set, no pager is used.

You can disable the pager for certain commands by adding them to the
pager.ignore list::

  [pager]
  ignore = version, help, update

You can also enable the pager only for certain commands using
pager.attend. Below is the default list of commands to be paged::

  [pager]
  attend = annotate, cat, diff, export, glog, log, qdiff

Setting pager.attend to an empty value will cause all commands to be
paged.

If pager.attend is present, pager.ignore will be ignored.

Lastly, you can enable and disable paging for individual commands with
the attend-<command> option. This setting takes precedence over
existing attend and ignore options and defaults::

  [pager]
  attend-cat = false

To ignore global commands like :hg:`version` or :hg:`help`, you have
to specify them in your user configuration file.

The --pager=... option can also be used to control when the pager is
used. Use a boolean value like yes, no, on, off, or use auto for
normal behavior.



patchbomb
=========

command to send changesets as (a series of) patch emails

The series is started off with a "[PATCH 0 of N]" introduction, which
describes the series as a whole.

Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using the
first line of the changeset description as the subject text. The
message contains two or three body parts:

- The changeset description.
- [Optional] The result of running diffstat on the patch.
- The patch itself, as generated by :hg:`export`.

Each message refers to the first in the series using the In-Reply-To
and References headers, so they will show up as a sequence in threaded
mail and news readers, and in mail archives.

To configure other defaults, add a section like this to your
configuration file::

  [email]
  from = My Name <my@email>
  to = recipient1, recipient2, ...
  cc = cc1, cc2, ...
  bcc = bcc1, bcc2, ...
  reply-to = address1, address2, ...

Use ``[patchbomb]`` as configuration section name if you need to
override global ``[email]`` address settings.

Then you can use the :hg:`email` command to mail a series of
changesets as a patchbomb.

You can also either configure the method option in the email section
to be a sendmail compatible mailer or fill out the [smtp] section so
that the patchbomb extension can automatically send patchbombs
directly from the commandline. See the [email] and [smtp] sections in
hgrc(5) for details.

You can control the default inclusion of an introduction message with the
``patchbomb.intro`` configuration option. The configuration is always
overwritten by command line flags like --intro and --desc::

  [patchbomb]
  intro=auto   # include introduction message if more than 1 patch (default)
  intro=never  # never include an introduction message
  intro=always # always include an introduction message

You can set patchbomb to always ask for confirmation by setting
``patchbomb.confirm`` to true.


Commands
--------

email
.....

send changesets by email::

   hg email [OPTION]... [DEST]...

By default, diffs are sent in the format generated by
:hg:`export`, one per message. The series starts with a "[PATCH 0
of N]" introduction, which describes the series as a whole.

Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using
the first line of the changeset description as the subject text.
The message contains two or three parts. First, the changeset
description.

With the -d/--diffstat option, if the diffstat program is
installed, the result of running diffstat on the patch is inserted.

Finally, the patch itself, as generated by :hg:`export`.

With the -d/--diffstat or --confirm options, you will be presented
with a final summary of all messages and asked for confirmation before
the messages are sent.

By default the patch is included as text in the email body for
easy reviewing. Using the -a/--attach option will instead create
an attachment for the patch. With -i/--inline an inline attachment
will be created. You can include a patch both as text in the email
body and as a regular or an inline attachment by combining the
-a/--attach or -i/--inline with the --body option.

With -o/--outgoing, emails will be generated for patches not found
in the destination repository (or only those which are ancestors
of the specified revisions if any are provided)

With -b/--bundle, changesets are selected as for --outgoing, but a
single email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an attachment
will be sent. Use the ``patchbomb.bundletype`` config option to
control the bundle type as with :hg:`bundle --type`.

With -m/--mbox, instead of previewing each patchbomb message in a
pager or sending the messages directly, it will create a UNIX
mailbox file with the patch emails. This mailbox file can be
previewed with any mail user agent which supports UNIX mbox
files.

With -n/--test, all steps will run, but mail will not be sent.
You will be prompted for an email recipient address, a subject and
an introductory message describing the patches of your patchbomb.
Then when all is done, patchbomb messages are displayed. If the
PAGER environment variable is set, your pager will be fired up once
for each patchbomb message, so you can verify everything is alright.

In case email sending fails, you will find a backup of your series
introductory message in ``.hg/last-email.txt``.

The default behavior of this command can be customized through
configuration. (See :hg:`help patchbomb` for details)

Examples::

  hg email -r 3000          # send patch 3000 only
  hg email -r 3000 -r 3001  # send patches 3000 and 3001
  hg email -r 3000:3005     # send patches 3000 through 3005
  hg email 3000             # send patch 3000 (deprecated)

  hg email -o               # send all patches not in default
  hg email -o DEST          # send all patches not in DEST
  hg email -o -r 3000       # send all ancestors of 3000 not in default
  hg email -o -r 3000 DEST  # send all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

  hg email -b               # send bundle of all patches not in default
  hg email -b DEST          # send bundle of all patches not in DEST
  hg email -b -r 3000       # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in default
  hg email -b -r 3000 DEST  # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

  hg email -o -m mbox &&    # generate an mbox file...
    mutt -R -f mbox         # ... and view it with mutt
  hg email -o -m mbox &&    # generate an mbox file ...
    formail -s sendmail \   # ... and use formail to send from the mbox
      -bm -t < mbox         # ... using sendmail

Before using this command, you will need to enable email in your
hgrc. See the [email] section in hgrc(5) for details.

Options:

-g, --git              use git extended diff format

progress
========

show progress bars for some actions (DEPRECATED)

This extension has been merged into core, you can remove it from your config.
See hg help config.progress for configuration options.


purge
=====

command to delete untracked files from the working directory

Commands
--------

purge
.....

removes files not tracked by Mercurial::

   hg purge [OPTION]... [DIR]...

Delete files not known to Mercurial. This is useful to test local
and uncommitted changes in an otherwise-clean source tree.

This means that purge will delete the following by default:

- Unknown files: files marked with "?" by :hg:`status`
- Empty directories: in fact Mercurial ignores directories unless
  they contain files under source control management

But it will leave untouched:

- Modified and unmodified tracked files
- Ignored files (unless --all is specified)
- New files added to the repository (with :hg:`add`)

The --files and --dirs options can be used to direct purge to delete
only files, only directories, or both. If neither option is given,
both will be deleted.

If directories are given on the command line, only files in these
directories are considered.

Be careful with purge, as you could irreversibly delete some files
you forgot to add to the repository. If you only want to print the
list of files that this program would delete, use the --print
option.

Options:

-a, --abort-on-err          abort if an error occurs
--all                       purge ignored files too
--dirs                      purge empty directories
--files                     purge files

rebase
======

command to move sets of revisions to a different ancestor

This extension lets you rebase changesets in an existing Mercurial
repository.

For more information:
https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension


Commands
--------

rebase
......

move changeset (and descendants) to a different branch::

   hg rebase [-s REV | -b REV] [-d REV] [OPTION]

Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of
history (the source) onto another (the destination). This can be
useful for linearizing *local* changes relative to a master
development tree.

You should not rebase changesets that have already been shared
with others. Doing so will force everybody else to perform the
same rebase or they will end up with duplicated changesets after
pulling in your rebased changesets.

In its default configuration, Mercurial will prevent you from
rebasing published changes. See :hg:`help phases` for details.

If you don't specify a destination changeset (``-d/--dest``),
rebase uses the current branch tip as the destination. (The
destination changeset is not modified by rebasing, but new
changesets are added as its descendants.)

You can specify which changesets to rebase in two ways: as a
"source" changeset or as a "base" changeset. Both are shorthand
for a topologically related set of changesets (the "source
branch"). If you specify source (``-s/--source``), rebase will
rebase that changeset and all of its descendants onto dest. If you
specify base (``-b/--base``), rebase will select ancestors of base
back to but not including the common ancestor with dest. Thus,
``-b`` is less precise but more convenient than ``-s``: you can
specify any changeset in the source branch, and rebase will select
the whole branch. If you specify neither ``-s`` nor ``-b``, rebase
uses the parent of the working directory as the base.

For advanced usage, a third way is available through the ``--rev``
option. It allows you to specify an arbitrary set of changesets to
rebase. Descendants of revs you specify with this option are not
automatically included in the rebase.

By default, rebase recreates the changesets in the source branch
as descendants of dest and then destroys the originals. Use
``--keep`` to preserve the original source changesets. Some
changesets in the source branch (e.g. merges from the destination
branch) may be dropped if they no longer contribute any change.

One result of the rules for selecting the destination changeset
and source branch is that, unlike ``merge``, rebase will do
nothing if you are at the branch tip of a named branch
with two heads. You need to explicitly specify source and/or
destination (or ``update`` to the other head, if it's the head of
the intended source branch).

If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a merge, it can be
continued with --continue/-c or aborted with --abort/-a.

.. container:: verbose

  Examples:

  - move "local changes" (current commit back to branching point)
    to the current branch tip after a pull::

      hg rebase

  - move a single changeset to the stable branch::

      hg rebase -r 5f493448 -d stable

  - splice a commit and all its descendants onto another part of history::

      hg rebase --source c0c3 --dest 4cf9

  - rebase everything on a branch marked by a bookmark onto the
    default branch::

      hg rebase --base myfeature --dest default

  - collapse a sequence of changes into a single commit::

      hg rebase --collapse -r 1520:1525 -d .

  - move a named branch while preserving its name::

      hg rebase -r "branch(featureX)" -d 1.3 --keepbranches

Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to rebase or there are
unresolved conflicts.

Options:

-s, --source <REV>         rebase the specified changeset and descendants
-b, --base <REV>           rebase everything from branching point of specified changeset
-r, --rev <REV[+]>         rebase these revisions
-d, --dest <REV>           rebase onto the specified changeset
--collapse                 collapse the rebased changesets
-m, --message <TEXT>       use text as collapse commit message
-e, --edit                 invoke editor on commit messages
-l, --logfile <FILE>       read collapse commit message from file
-k, --keep                 keep original changesets
--keepbranches             keep original branch names
-D, --detach               (DEPRECATED)
-i, --interactive          (DEPRECATED)
-t, --tool <VALUE>         specify merge tool
-c, --continue             continue an interrupted rebase
-a, --abort                abort an interrupted rebase
--style <STYLE>            display using template map file (DEPRECATED)
-T, --template <TEMPLATE>  display with template

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

record
======

commands to interactively select changes for commit/qrefresh

Commands
--------

qrecord
.......

interactively record a new patch::

   hg qrecord [OPTION]... PATCH [FILE]...

See :hg:`help qnew` & :hg:`help record` for more information and
usage.

record
......

interactively select changes to commit::

   hg record [OPTION]... [FILE]...

If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by :hg:`status`
will be candidates for recording.

See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

You will be prompted for whether to record changes to each
modified file, and for files with multiple changes, for each
change to use. For each query, the following responses are
possible::

  y - record this change
  n - skip this change
  e - edit this change manually

  s - skip remaining changes to this file
  f - record remaining changes to this file

  d - done, skip remaining changes and files
  a - record all changes to all remaining files
  q - quit, recording no changes

  ? - display help

This command is not available when committing a merge.

Options:

-A, --addremove             mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing
--close-branch              mark a branch head as closed
--amend                     amend the parent of the working directory
-s, --secret                use the secret phase for committing
-e, --edit                  invoke editor on commit messages
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message <TEXT>        use text as commit message
-l, --logfile <FILE>        read commit message from file
-d, --date <DATE>           record the specified date as commit date
-u, --user <USER>           record the specified user as committer
-S, --subrepos              recurse into subrepositories
-w, --ignore-all-space      ignore white space when comparing lines
-b, --ignore-space-change   ignore changes in the amount of white space
-B, --ignore-blank-lines    ignore changes whose lines are all blank

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

relink
======

recreates hardlinks between repository clones

Commands
--------

relink
......

recreate hardlinks between two repositories::

   hg relink [ORIGIN]

When repositories are cloned locally, their data files will be
hardlinked so that they only use the space of a single repository.

Unfortunately, subsequent pulls into either repository will break
hardlinks for any files touched by the new changesets, even if
both repositories end up pulling the same changes.

Similarly, passing --rev to "hg clone" will fail to use any
hardlinks, falling back to a complete copy of the source
repository.

This command lets you recreate those hardlinks and reclaim that
wasted space.

This repository will be relinked to share space with ORIGIN, which
must be on the same local disk. If ORIGIN is omitted, looks for
"default-relink", then "default", in [paths].

Do not attempt any read operations on this repository while the
command is running. (Both repositories will be locked against
writes.)

schemes
=======

extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms

This extension allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs with a
lot of repositories to act like a scheme, for example::

  [schemes]
  py = http://code.python.org/hg/

After that you can use it like::

  hg clone py://trunk/

Additionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for
example used by Google Code::

  [schemes]
  gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/

The syntax is taken from Mercurial templates, and you have unlimited
number of variables, starting with ``{1}`` and continuing with
``{2}``, ``{3}`` and so on. This variables will receive parts of URL
supplied, split by ``/``. Anything not specified as ``{part}`` will be
just appended to an URL.

For convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default::

  [schemes]
  py = http://hg.python.org/
  bb = https://bitbucket.org/
  bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/
  gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
  kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/

You can override a predefined scheme by defining a new scheme with the
same name.


share
=====

share a common history between several working directories

Automatic Pooled Storage for Clones
-----------------------------------

When this extension is active, :hg:`clone` can be configured to
automatically share/pool storage across multiple clones. This
mode effectively converts :hg:`clone` to :hg:`clone` + :hg:`share`.
The benefit of using this mode is the automatic management of
store paths and intelligent pooling of related repositories.

The following ``share.`` config options influence this feature:

``share.pool``
    Filesystem path where shared repository data will be stored. When
    defined, :hg:`clone` will automatically use shared repository
    storage instead of creating a store inside each clone.

``share.poolnaming``
    How directory names in ``share.pool`` are constructed.

    "identity" means the name is derived from the first changeset in the
    repository. In this mode, different remotes share storage if their
    root/initial changeset is identical. In this mode, the local shared
    repository is an aggregate of all encountered remote repositories.

    "remote" means the name is derived from the source repository's
    path or URL. In this mode, storage is only shared if the path or URL
    requested in the :hg:`clone` command matches exactly to a repository
    that was cloned before.

    The default naming mode is "identity."


Commands
--------

share
.....

create a new shared repository::

   hg share [-U] [-B] SOURCE [DEST]

Initialize a new repository and working directory that shares its
history (and optionally bookmarks) with another repository.

.. note::

   using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history (mq,
   rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with shared
   clones. In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to
   the same changeset, and one of them destroys that changeset
   with rollback, the other clone will suddenly stop working: all
   operations will fail with "abort: working directory has unknown
   parent". The only known workaround is to use debugsetparents on
   the broken clone to reset it to a changeset that still exists.

Options:

-U, --noupdate   do not create a working directory
-B, --bookmarks  also share bookmarks

unshare
.......

convert a shared repository to a normal one::

   hg unshare

Copy the store data to the repo and remove the sharedpath data.

shelve
======

save and restore changes to the working directory

The "hg shelve" command saves changes made to the working directory
and reverts those changes, resetting the working directory to a clean
state.

Later on, the "hg unshelve" command restores the changes saved by "hg
shelve". Changes can be restored even after updating to a different
parent, in which case Mercurial's merge machinery will resolve any
conflicts if necessary.

You can have more than one shelved change outstanding at a time; each
shelved change has a distinct name. For details, see the help for "hg
shelve".


Commands
--------

shelve
......

save and set aside changes from the working directory::

   hg shelve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Shelving takes files that "hg status" reports as not clean, saves
the modifications to a bundle (a shelved change), and reverts the
files so that their state in the working directory becomes clean.

To restore these changes to the working directory, using "hg
unshelve"; this will work even if you switch to a different
commit.

When no files are specified, "hg shelve" saves all not-clean
files. If specific files or directories are named, only changes to
those files are shelved.

Each shelved change has a name that makes it easier to find later.
The name of a shelved change defaults to being based on the active
bookmark, or if there is no active bookmark, the current named
branch.  To specify a different name, use ``--name``.

To see a list of existing shelved changes, use the ``--list``
option. For each shelved change, this will print its name, age,
and description; use ``--patch`` or ``--stat`` for more details.

To delete specific shelved changes, use ``--delete``. To delete
all shelved changes, use ``--cleanup``.

Options:

-A, --addremove             mark new/missing files as added/removed before shelving
--cleanup                   delete all shelved changes
--date <DATE>               shelve with the specified commit date
-d, --delete                delete the named shelved change(s)
-e, --edit                  invoke editor on commit messages
-l, --list                  list current shelves
-m, --message <TEXT>        use text as shelve message
-n, --name <NAME>           use the given name for the shelved commit
-p, --patch                 show patch
-i, --interactive           interactive mode, only works while creating a shelve
--stat                      output diffstat-style summary of changes
-I, --include <PATTERN[+]>  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude <PATTERN[+]>  exclude names matching the given patterns

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

unshelve
........

restore a shelved change to the working directory::

   hg unshelve [SHELVED]

This command accepts an optional name of a shelved change to
restore. If none is given, the most recent shelved change is used.

If a shelved change is applied successfully, the bundle that
contains the shelved changes is moved to a backup location
(.hg/shelve-backup).

Since you can restore a shelved change on top of an arbitrary
commit, it is possible that unshelving will result in a conflict
between your changes and the commits you are unshelving onto. If
this occurs, you must resolve the conflict, then use
``--continue`` to complete the unshelve operation. (The bundle
will not be moved until you successfully complete the unshelve.)

(Alternatively, you can use ``--abort`` to abandon an unshelve
that causes a conflict. This reverts the unshelved changes, and
leaves the bundle in place.)

After a successful unshelve, the shelved changes are stored in a
backup directory. Only the N most recent backups are kept. N
defaults to 10 but can be overridden using the ``shelve.maxbackups``
configuration option.

.. container:: verbose

   Timestamp in seconds is used to decide order of backups. More
   than ``maxbackups`` backups are kept, if same timestamp
   prevents from deciding exact order of them, for safety.

Options:

-a, --abort     abort an incomplete unshelve operation
-c, --continue  continue an incomplete unshelve operation
--keep          keep shelve after unshelving
--date <DATE>   set date for temporary commits (DEPRECATED)

strip
=====

strip changesets and their descendants from history

This extension allows you to strip changesets and all their descendants from the
repository. See the command help for details.


Commands
--------

strip
.....

strip changesets and all their descendants from the repository::

   hg strip [-k] [-f] [-n] [-B bookmark] [-r] REV...

The strip command removes the specified changesets and all their
descendants. If the working directory has uncommitted changes, the
operation is aborted unless the --force flag is supplied, in which
case changes will be discarded.

If a parent of the working directory is stripped, then the working
directory will automatically be updated to the most recent
available ancestor of the stripped parent after the operation
completes.

Any stripped changesets are stored in ``.hg/strip-backup`` as a
bundle (see :hg:`help bundle` and :hg:`help unbundle`). They can
be restored by running :hg:`unbundle .hg/strip-backup/BUNDLE`,
where BUNDLE is the bundle file created by the strip. Note that
the local revision numbers will in general be different after the
restore.

Use the --no-backup option to discard the backup bundle once the
operation completes.

Strip is not a history-rewriting operation and can be used on
changesets in the public phase. But if the stripped changesets have
been pushed to a remote repository you will likely pull them again.

Return 0 on success.

Options:

-r, --rev <REV[+]>      strip specified revision (optional, can specify revisions without this option)
-f, --force             force removal of changesets, discard uncommitted changes (no backup)
--no-backup             no backups
--nobackup              no backups (DEPRECATED)
-n                      ignored  (DEPRECATED)
-k, --keep              do not modify working directory during strip
-B, --bookmark <VALUE>  remove revs only reachable from given bookmark

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

transplant
==========

command to transplant changesets from another branch

This extension allows you to transplant changes to another parent revision,
possibly in another repository. The transplant is done using 'diff' patches.

Transplanted patches are recorded in .hg/transplant/transplants, as a
map from a changeset hash to its hash in the source repository.


Commands
--------

transplant
..........

transplant changesets from another branch::

   hg transplant [-s REPO] [-b BRANCH [-a]] [-p REV] [-m REV] [REV]...

Selected changesets will be applied on top of the current working
directory with the log of the original changeset. The changesets
are copied and will thus appear twice in the history with different
identities.

Consider using the graft command if everything is inside the same
repository - it will use merges and will usually give a better result.
Use the rebase extension if the changesets are unpublished and you want
to move them instead of copying them.

If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended
of the form::

  (transplanted from CHANGESETHASH)

You can rewrite the changelog message with the --filter option.
Its argument will be invoked with the current changelog message as
$1 and the patch as $2.

--source/-s specifies another repository to use for selecting changesets,
just as if it temporarily had been pulled.
If --branch/-b is specified, these revisions will be used as
heads when deciding which changesets to transplant, just as if only
these revisions had been pulled.
If --all/-a is specified, all the revisions up to the heads specified
with --branch will be transplanted.

Example:

- transplant all changes up to REV on top of your current revision::

    hg transplant --branch REV --all

You can optionally mark selected transplanted changesets as merge
changesets. You will not be prompted to transplant any ancestors
of a merged transplant, and you can merge descendants of them
normally instead of transplanting them.

Merge changesets may be transplanted directly by specifying the
proper parent changeset by calling :hg:`transplant --parent`.

If no merges or revisions are provided, :hg:`transplant` will
start an interactive changeset browser.

If a changeset application fails, you can fix the merge by hand
and then resume where you left off by calling :hg:`transplant
--continue/-c`.

Options:

-s, --source <REPO>    transplant changesets from REPO
-b, --branch <REV[+]>  use this source changeset as head
-a, --all              pull all changesets up to the --branch revisions
-p, --prune <REV[+]>   skip over REV
-m, --merge <REV[+]>   merge at REV
--parent <REV>         parent to choose when transplanting merge
-e, --edit             invoke editor on commit messages
--log                  append transplant info to log message
-c, --continue         continue last transplant session after fixing conflicts
--filter <CMD>         filter changesets through command

[+] marked option can be specified multiple times

win32mbcs
=========

allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic encodings

Some MBCS encodings are not good for some path operations (i.e.
splitting path, case conversion, etc.) with its encoded bytes. We call
such a encoding (i.e. shift_jis and big5) as "problematic encoding".
This extension can be used to fix the issue with those encodings by
wrapping some functions to convert to Unicode string before path
operation.

This extension is useful for:

- Japanese Windows users using shift_jis encoding.
- Chinese Windows users using big5 encoding.
- All users who use a repository with one of problematic encodings on
  case-insensitive file system.

This extension is not needed for:

- Any user who use only ASCII chars in path.
- Any user who do not use any of problematic encodings.

Note that there are some limitations on using this extension:

- You should use single encoding in one repository.
- If the repository path ends with 0x5c, .hg/hgrc cannot be read.
- win32mbcs is not compatible with fixutf8 extension.

By default, win32mbcs uses encoding.encoding decided by Mercurial.
You can specify the encoding by config option::

 [win32mbcs]
 encoding = sjis

It is useful for the users who want to commit with UTF-8 log message.


win32text
=========

perform automatic newline conversion (DEPRECATED)

  Deprecation: The win32text extension requires each user to configure
  the extension again and again for each clone since the configuration
  is not copied when cloning.

  We have therefore made the ``eol`` as an alternative. The ``eol``
  uses a version controlled file for its configuration and each clone
  will therefore use the right settings from the start.

To perform automatic newline conversion, use::

  [extensions]
  win32text =
  [encode]
  ** = cleverencode:
  # or ** = macencode:

  [decode]
  ** = cleverdecode:
  # or ** = macdecode:

If not doing conversion, to make sure you do not commit CRLF/CR by accident::

  [hooks]
  pretxncommit.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
  # or pretxncommit.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr

To do the same check on a server to prevent CRLF/CR from being
pushed or pulled::

  [hooks]
  pretxnchangegroup.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
  # or pretxnchangegroup.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr


zeroconf
========

discover and advertise repositories on the local network

Zeroconf-enabled repositories will be announced in a network without
the need to configure a server or a service. They can be discovered
without knowing their actual IP address.

To allow other people to discover your repository using run
:hg:`serve` in your repository::

  $ cd test
  $ hg serve

You can discover Zeroconf-enabled repositories by running
:hg:`paths`::

  $ hg paths
  zc-test = http://example.com:8000/test
